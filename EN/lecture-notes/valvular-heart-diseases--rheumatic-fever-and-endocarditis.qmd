# Valvular Heart Diseases, Rheumatic Fever and Endocarditis

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# VALVULAR HEART DISEASES

# Stenosis

* __Failure of a valve to open completely__
* __Obstructing forward flow__
* __Chronic process__
  * _Calcification or valve scarring_

# Insufficiency

* __Failure of a valve to close completely__
* __Regurgitation \(backflow\) of blood__
* __Caused by:__
  * __Intrinsic disease of the valve cusps__
    * __Endocarditis__
  * __Disruption of the supporting structures__
    * __Aorta\, mitral annulus\, tendinous cords\, papillary muscles\, ventricular free wall __
* __Can be acute or chronic__
  * __Chordal rupture__
  * __Leaflet scarring and retraction__

# Stenosis and regurgitation

* __Can occur alone or together__
* __Can involve only one valve__
  * __Mitral valve most common__
* __More than one valve__
* __Murmurs__

* __Outcome depends on:__
* __ Valve involved__
* __ Degree of impairment__
* __ Speed of pathology__
* __ Effectiveness of compensatory mechanisms__
* __Sudden destruction of an aortic valve cusp by infection__
  * __Massive regurgitation\, abrupt cardiac failure__
* __Rheumatic mitral stenosis__
  * __Progresses over years__
  * __Well tolerated until late in the course__

# Bicuspid aortic valve

__Most common congenital valvular lesion__
