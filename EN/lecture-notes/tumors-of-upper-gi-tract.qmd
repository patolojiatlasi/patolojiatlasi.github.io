# TUMORS OF SALIVARY GLANDS

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Upper-GI-Tract3.png)

__Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease__

__65% to 80% arise within the parotid__

__10% in the submandibular gland__

__remainder in the minor salivary glands\, including the sublingual glands__

__15% to 30% of tumors in the parotid glands are malignant__

__40% of submandibular\, 50% of minor salivary gland\, and 70% to 90% of sublingual tumors are cancerous__

_Likelihood that a salivary gland tumor is malignant is inversely proportional\, roughly\, to the size of the gland_
