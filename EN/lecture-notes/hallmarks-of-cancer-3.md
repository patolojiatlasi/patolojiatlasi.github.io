# Homing - Organ tropism

**Metastasis occur according to dissemination site and vascular
pathway**

**Although skeletal muscle has abundant muscle supply, it is not a site
of metastasis**

**Expression of adhesion molecules by tumor cells whose ligands are
expressed preferentially on the endothelium of target organs**

**Expression of chemokines and their receptors**

**Human breast cancer cells express high levels of the chemokine
receptors CXCR4 and CCR7**

**The ligands for these receptors (chemokines CXCL12 and CCL21) are
highly expressed only in those organs to which breast cancer cells
metastasize**

# GENOMIC INSTABILITY AS AN ENABLER OF MALIGNANCY

# DNA repair

- **DNA repair is defected in some inherited cancer syndromes**
- **Normal DNA repair systems:**
  - **Mismatch repair**
  - **Nucleotide excision repair**
  - **Recombination repair**

# Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer Syndrome

**Familial carcinomas of the cecum and proximal colon**

**Defects in genes of DNA mismatch repair**

**When DNA is repaired, these genes act as “spell checkers.”**

**Without them errors accumulate at an increased rate**

**Microsatellite instability (MSI) occurs**

# Xeroderma Pigmentosum

**Ultraviolet rays in sunlight cause cross-linking of pyrimidine
residues**

**Prevent normal DNA replication**

**Inherited loss of this repair causes many skin tumors**

# Diseases with Defects in DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination

**Autosomal recessive**

**Hypersensitivity to other DNA-damaging agents**

**Ionizing radiation (in Bloom syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia)**

**DNA cross-linking agents, such as nitrogen mustard (in Fanconi
anemia)**

# BRCA1 and BRCA2

**DNA repair genes**

**When activitiy is lost leads to Hereditary and sporadic breast and
ovarian tumors**

**Genes involved in homologous recombination DNA repair pathway **

**Hereditary breast cancer**

**Women with BRCA1 mutations higher risk of epithelial ovarian cancers,
and men have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer**

**Mutations in the BRCA2 gene increase the risk of breast cancer in both
men and women, as well as cancer of the ovary, prostate, pancreas, bile
ducts, stomach, melanocytes, and B lymphocytes**

# Cancers Resulting From Mutations Induced by Regulated Genomic Instability: Lymphoid Neoplasms

**A special type of DNA damage plays a central role in the pathogenesis
of tumors of B and T lymphocytes. As described earlier, adaptive
immunity relies on the ability of B and T cells to diversify their
antigen receptor genes. Early B and T cells both express a pair of gene
products, RAG1 and RAG2, that carry out V(D)J segment recombination,
permitting the assembling of functional antigen receptor genes. In
addition, after encountering antigen, mature B cells express a
specialized enzyme called activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID),
which catalyzes both immunoglobulin gene class switch recombination and
somatic hypermutation**

  - **Barrett esophagus**
  - **Ulcerative colitis**
  - **H. pylori gastritis**
  - **Hepatitis B and C**
  - **Chronic pancreatitis**
- **Continuous regeneration, decreased apoptosis, increased

- **Neutrophils**
  - **Secrete reactive oxygen radicals**
  - **DNA damage**

- **Amount changes in tumors**
- **Thought to be protective, trying to destroy tumor**
- **But**
  - **They release growth factor**
  - **Increase DNA damage**
  - **Increase epithelial-mesenchymal transition**
