# Asbestos

__Concentration\, size\, shape\, and solubility of the different forms of asbestos affect pathogenesis__

__Two distinct forms of asbestos__

__Serpentine__

__Amphibole__

__Both are pathogenic for all diseases__

# Serpentine

__Fiber is curly and flexible__

__Serpentine chrysotile accounts for most of the asbestos used in industry__

__Impacted in the upper respiratory passages and removed by the mucociliary elevator__

__Those that are trapped in the lungs are gradually leached from the tissues\, because they are more soluble than amphiboles __

# Amphibole

__Fiber is straight\, stiff\, and brittle__

__More pathogenic than the serpentine chrysotile__

__Align themselves in the airstream → delivered deeper into the lungs → penetrate epithelial cells to reach the interstitium__

# Both forms cause disease

* __Increasing exposure to either form__
  * __associated with a higher incidence of all asbestos\-related diseases__
* __Interaction of particulates with lung macrophages → fibrosis__
* __Functions as both a tumor initiator and a promoter__
  * __Reactive free radicals generated by asbestos fibers → mesothelial tumors__
  * __Potentially toxic chemicals adsorbed onto the asbestos fibers__
    * __Tobacco smoking__

# Asbestosis

__Diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis__

__Indistinguishable from UIP__

__Except for the presence of asbestos bodies__

# Asbestos Bodies

* __Golden brown\, fusiform or beaded rods with a translucent center__
* __Coated with an iron\-containing proteinaceous material__
* __Formed when macrophages attempt to phagocytose asbestos fibers__
  * __The iron is derived from phagocyte ferritin__
* __Can be found in the lungs of normal persons__
  * __Much lower concentrations and without an accompanying interstitial fibrosis\.__

![](./img-local/Chronic-Interstitial-Lung-Diseases25.png)

# Asbestosis

* __Begins in the lower lobes and subpleurally__
  * __In contrast with CWP and silicosis__

* __Scarring trap and narrow pulmonary arteries and arterioles__
  * __Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale__

![](./img-local/Chronic-Interstitial-Lung-Diseases27.png)

__Often contain calcium__

__Most frequently on the anterior and posterolateral aspects of the parietal pleura and over the domes of the diaphragm__

__Do not contain asbestos bodies__

__Rarely occur in persons with no history or evidence of asbestos exposure __

__Uncommonly\, asbestos exposure induces pleural effusion or diffuse pleural fibrosis\.__
