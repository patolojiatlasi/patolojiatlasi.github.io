# Injury in central nervous system

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# CNS

- **Anatomy is important**
  - **Signs, symptoms and clinical features depend on anatomy**
- **Histology and reaction patterns are different**
- **Have unique tumors and diseases**

# PATTERNS OF INJURY IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

# Features of Neuronal Injury

- **Within 12 hours of an irreversible hypoxic-ischemic insult**
  - **acute neuronal injury**
    - **Changes in cell body**
    - **Changes in axons**
    - **Changes in body seconder to axonal injury**
  - **breakdown of the blood-brain barrier**
    - **cerebral edema**

**Shrinkage of the cell body, pyknosis of the nucleus, disappearance of
the nucleolus, and loss of Nissl substance, with intense eosinophilia of
the cytoplasm (“red neurons”)**

**Nucleus assumes the angulated shape of the shrunken cell body **

**Acute hypoxic-ischemic injury in cerebral cortex, where the individual
cell bodies are shrunken, along with the nuclei. They also are
prominently stained by eosin (“red neurons”).**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Injured axons undergo swelling and show disruption of axonal
transport**

**Swellings (spheroids) can be recognized on H&E stains and can be
highlighted by silver staining or immunohistochemistry.**

**Axonal spheroids are visible as bulbous swellings at points of
disruption, or altered axonal transport.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Axonal injury**

**-leads to cell body enlargement and rounding**

**-peripheral displacement of the nucleus**

**-enlargement of the nucleolus**

**-peripheral dispersion of Nissl substance (central chromatolysis)**

**C: With axonal injury there can be swelling of the cell body and
peripheral dispersal of the Nissl substance, termed chromatolysis.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Other diseases also cause changes in neurons

- **Specific intracellular inclusions**
  - **Neurodegenerative diseases**
    - **Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease**
    - **Tangles in Alzheimer disease**
  - **Pathogenic viruses**
- **Neuronal processes**
  - **thickened and tortuous In some neurodegenerative diseases**
  - **dystrophic neurites**
- **Age**
  - **cytoplasm and lysosomes**
  - **accumulate complex lipids (lipofuscin)**

# Astrocytes in Injury and Repair

- **Principal cells responsible for repair and scar formation in the
  brain**
- **Gliosis**
- **Astrocytes undergo both hypertrophy and hyperplasia**
- **Nucleus enlarges and becomes vesicular**
- **Nucleolus becomes prominent**
- **Gemistocytic astrocyte**
  - **Previously scant cytoplasm expands and takes on a bright pink hue,
    and the cell extends multiple stout, ramifying processes**

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

# Fibroblasts

**Participate in healing after brain injury to a limited extent**

**Except in penetrating brain trauma or around abscesses**

# Fibrillary astrocytes

**Long-standing gliosis**

**Cytoplasm of reactive astrocytes shrinks in size**

**Cellular processes become more tightly interwoven**

# Rosenthal fibers

**Thick, elongated, brightly eosinophilic protein aggregates found in
astrocytic processes in chronic gliosis and in some low-grade gliomas**

# Oligodendrocytes

- **Produce myelin**
- **Limited spectrum of specific morphologic changes in response to
  various injuries**
- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**
  - **viral inclusions**
  - **smudgy, homogeneous-appearing enlarged nucleus**

# Microglial cells

**Bone-marrow–derived cells**

**Function as the resident phagocytes of the CNS**

**Activated by tissue injury, infection, or trauma**

**Proliferate and become more prominent histologically**

- **Take on the appearance of activated macrophages**
  - **In areas of demyelination, organizing infarct, or hemorrhage**
- **Rod cells**
  - **Neurosyphilis or other infections, they develop elongated nuclei**
- **Microglial nodules**
  - **Aggregates of elongated microglial cells at sites of tissue
    injury**
- **Neuronophagia**
  - **Collections congregating around and phagocytosing injured
    neurons**

# Ependymal cells

- **Cytomegalovirus**
  - **can produce extensive ependymal injury**
  - **typical viral inclusions**
