**The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma**

**0.02% per year for chronic hepatitis B**

**2.5% per year when cirrhosis has developed**

# Hepatitis B

**HBV replication does not involve the integration of the virus in the
DNA of the host cell**

**Integrated HBV frequently is found in cells**

**The integrated viruses generally have large deletions and
rearrangements and usually become inactive**

- **HBcAg**
  - **The precore/core region of a nucleocapsid “core” protein, the
    hepatitis B core antigen**
  - **retained in the infected hepatocyte**
- **HBeAg**
  - **a precore protein**
  - **secreted into blood and is essential for the establishment of
    persistent infection**
- **HBsAg**
  - **Envelope glycoprotein**
  - **surface antigen**
  - **produced and secreted into the blood in massive amounts**
  - **Blood HBsAg is immunogenic**
- **A DNA polymerase**
  - **error-prone reverse transcriptase activity**
  - **generates mutations in the genomes of replicating virus at a high
    rate**
- **HBV-X protein**
  - **transcriptional transactivator for many viral and host genes**
  - **required for viral infectivity**
  - **may have a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by
    regulating p53 degradation and expression**

**Innate immunity protects the host during the initial phases of the
infection**

**A strong response by virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ interferon
γ–producing cells is associated with the resolution of acute infection**

**HBV does not cause direct hepatocyte injury**

**Hepatocyte damage results from killing of the virus-infected cells by
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells**

**Chronic HBV infection**

**Some hepatocytes may have viral genomes integrated into the host
genome**

**If surface antigen gene integrates cell produces it**

**Usually in such cells full viral replication does not take place**

**The antigen just accumulates in these cells**

**Large cytoplasmic inclusion consisting of endoplasmic reticulum
stuffed with surface antigen **

**Fine, smoothly granular appearance similar to that of ground glass**

**Ground-glass hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B, caused by
accumulation of HBsAg in cytoplasm, have large, pale, finely granular,
pink cytoplasmic inclusions on hematoxylin-eosin staining**

# Hepatitis C

**Subclassified into six genotypes, based on the genetic sequence**

**Infected person may carry many HCV variants**

![](./img-local/Viral-and-Autoimmune-Hepatitis17.png)

**The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is 1% to 4% per year**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Anti-HCV antibodies develop within weeks to a few months, they do not
confer effective immunity**

**Strong immune responses involving CD4+ and CD8+ cells are associated
with self-limited HCV infections**

**It is not known why only a minority of persons are capable of clearing
HCV infection**

**Persistent infection is the hallmark of HCV infection, occurring in
80% to 85% of patients with subclinical or asymptomatic acute
infection**

- **Typical features of chronic hepatitis**
- **Fatty change**
  - **Altered lipid metabolism in infected hepatocytes**
  - **Insulin resistance**
- **Lymphoid infiltrates in portal tracts, sometimes with fully formed
  lymphoid follicles**
- **Bile duct injury**
  - **Direct infection of cholangiocytes by the virus**

**In HBV and HCV infection, circulating antibody-antigen complexes
produce immune-complex disease in the form of vasculitis (subcutaneous
or visceral) and glomerulonephritis**

**Cryoglobulinemia is found in 50% of patients with hepatitis C**

# Hepatitis D Virus

- **Delta hepatitis virus**
- **Arises in two settings**
- **Acute coinfection after exposure to serum containing both HDV and
  HBV**
  - **Most coinfected persons clear the viruses and recover completely**
- **Superinfection of a chronic carrier of HBV with a new inoculum of
  HDV**
  - **Most superinfected persons there is an acceleration of hepatitis,
    progressing to more severe chronic hepatitis 4 to 7 weeks later**

# Hepatitis E

**HEV hepatitis is an enterically transmitted, waterborne infection
occurring primarily beyond the years of infancy**

**Endemic in India**

**In most cases, the disease is self-limited; not associated with
chronic liver disease or persistent viremia**
