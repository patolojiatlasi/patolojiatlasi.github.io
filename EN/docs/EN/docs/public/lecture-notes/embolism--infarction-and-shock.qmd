# Embolus

* __intravascular solid\, liquid\, or gaseous mass__
* __carried by the blood to a site distant from its point of origin__
* __emboli derive from a dislodged thrombus__
  * __thromboembolism__
* __fat droplets__
* __bubbles of air or nitrogen__
* __atherosclerotic debris \(cholesterol emboli\)__
* __tumor fragments__
* __bone marrow__
* __amniotic fluid__

__emboli lodge in vessels too small to permit further passage__

__partial or complete vascular occlusion__

__ischemic necrosis \(infarction\)__

__embolization in the pulmonary circulation leads to hypoxia\, hypotension\, and right\-sided heart failure__

# Pulmonary Thromboembolism

![](./img-local/Embolism%2C-Infarction-and-Shock4.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

* __A major cause of hospital deaths__
* __Venous emboli__
* __Originate from thrombi within deep leg veins__
  * __proximal to the popliteal fossa__
  * __lower leg thrombi is uncommon__
* __Paradoxical embolism__

* __Fragmented thrombi from DVTs__
* __Pass through the right side of the heart__
* __Pulmonary vasculature__
* __Depending on size occlude__
  * __main pulmonary artery__
  * __bifurcation of the right and left pulmonary arteries \(saddle embolus\)__
  * __smaller\, branching arterioles__

__Can be multiple__

__Sequentially__

__Multiple places at the same time__

__Patient has increased risk if had one PTE__

__60\-80% are small and clinically silent__

__Undergo organization\, incorporated into the vascular wall__

__In some cases\, organization of thromboemboli\, bridging fibrous webs__

__A large embolus that blocks a major pulmonary artery can cause sudden death__

* __Embolic obstruction of medium\-sized arteries → subsequent rupture of capillaries → pulmonary hemorrhage__
* __Does not cause pulmonary infarction__
* __Intact bronchial circulation \(dual circulation\)__
* __A similar embolus in the setting of left\-sided cardiac failure__
  * __lead to a pulmonary infarct__

__Embolism to small end\-arteriolar pulmonary branches usually causes infarction__

__Multiple emboli occurring over time can cause pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure \(cor pulmonale\)__

# Systemic Thromboembolism

* __80% arise from intracardiac mural thrombi__
* __2/3 associated with left ventricular infarcts__
* __25% with dilated left atria \(secondary to mitral valve disease\)__
* __Remainder__
  * __aortic aneurysms__
  * __thrombi overlying ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques__
  * __fragmented valvular vegetations__
  * __venous system \(paradoxical emboli\)__
* __10% to 15% of systemic emboli are of unknown origin__

* __Common arteriolar embolization sites__
  * __lower extremities \(75%\)__
  * __central nervous system__
  * __intestines__
  * __kidneys__
  * __spleen__

  * __tachypnea__
  * __dyspnea__
  * __tachycardia__
  * __irritability__
  * __restlessness__
  * __delirium or coma__

* __Pathogenesis__

# Air Embolism

* __Gas bubbles obstruct vascular flow__
* __Cause distal ischemic injury__
* __Can occur during surgery__
* __Small venous gas emboli generally have no deleterious effects__
* __Sufficient air can enter the pulmonary circulation __
  * __during obstetric procedures__
  * __chest wall injury to cause hypoxia__
* __Very large venous emboli may arrest in the heart and cause death__

# Decompression sickness,

* __Scuba divers\, underwater construction workers\, and persons in unpressurized aircraft who undergo rapid ascent__
* __Caisson disease__
  * __recurrent or persistent gas emboli in the bones lead to multifocal ischemic necrosis__
* __High\-pressure chamber__

# INFARCTION

# Infarction

* __An area of ischemic necrosis__
* __Caused by occlusion of the vascular supply to the affected tissue__
* __A major cause of death__
  * __myocardial infarction__
  * __cerebral infarction__
  * __pulmonary infarction__
  * __bowel infarction__
  * __ischemic necrosis of distal extremities \(gangrene\)__
    * __diabetic patients__

# Causes of infarction

* __Arterial thrombosis__
* __Arterial embolism__
* __Vasospasm__
* __Expansion of an atheroma secondary to intraplaque hemorrhage__
* __Extrinsic compression of a vessel__

* __Edema within a confined space__
  * __in anterior tibial compartment syndrome__
* __Vessel twisting__
  * __in testicular torsion or bowel volvulus__
* __Traumatic vascular rupture__
* __Entrapment in a hernia sac__

__Venous thrombosis can cause infarction too__

__But the more common outcome is simply congestion__

__Bypass channels rapidly open to provide arterial inflow__

__Infarcts caused by venous thrombosis occur only in organs with a single efferent vein \(testis or ovary\)__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# White infarcts

![](./img-local/Embolism%2C-Infarction-and-Shock11.png)

* __Arterial occlusions in solid organs with end\-arterial circulations__
  * __heart\, spleen\, and kidney__
* __tissue density limits the blood from adjoining patent vascular beds__
* __Wedge\-shaped__
  * __Occluded vessel at the apex__
  * __Organ periphery forming the base__
  * __When the base is a serosal surface\, there is often an overlying fibrinous exudate__
  * __Lateral margins may be irregular__
    * __Reflecting flow from adjacent vessels__

__Margins of acute infarcts typically are indistinct and slightly hemorrhagic__

__With time\, the edges become better defined__

# Ischemic coagulative necrosis

* __An inflammatory response develop at the margins of infarcts__
  * __Few hours\, well defined within 1\-2 days__
* __Repair__
  * __Beginning in the preserved margins__
  * __Parenchymal regeneration or scar__
  * __In CNS → liquefactive necrosis__

__Kidney infarct\, replaced by a large fibrotic scar__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Septic infarctions

__Infected cardiac valve vegetations embolize__

__When microbes seed necrotic tissue\, infarct is converted into an abscess__

# Factors That Influence Infarct Development

* __The anatomy of the vascular supply__
* __The time over which the occlusion develops__
  * __Collateral circulation__
* __The intrinsic vulnerability of the affected tissue to ischemic injury__
* __The blood oxygen content__

# SHOCK

# Shock

__final common pathway for several potentially lethal events__

__myocardial infarction__

__pulmonary embolism__

__sepsis__

__Shock is characterized by systemic hypoperfusion of tissues__

__can be caused by diminished cardiac output__

* __Systemic inflammatory response syndrome \(SIRS\)__
  * __When there is no microorganism product__
