# Clinicopathological Features of Neoplasia and Epidemiology

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Clinical problems caused by both benign and malignant tumors

- **Location and pressure on/ infiltration of adjacent structures**
- **Functional activity**
  - **Hormone synthesis**
  - **Paraneoplastic syndromes**
- **Bleeding and infections**
  - **Tumor ulcerates through adjacent surfaces**
- **Rupture or infarction**
- **Cachexia or wasting**

# Effects of Tumor on Host

- **Location**
  - **1 cm pituitary adenoma → hypopituitarism**
  - **0.5 cm leiomyoma in renal artery → ischemia and hypertension**
  - **A small tumor on biliary tract → cholestasis, death**
- **Hormone production**
  - **Islet cell benign and malignant tumors → hyperinsulinemia →
    hypoglycemia**
  - **Adrenocotical neoplasms → hyperaldesteronism**
- **Ulcer**
  - **Tumors of GI tract**
  - **Intussusception**
  - **Intestinal obstruction**
  - **Infarct**

# Cancer Cachexia

**Progressive loss of body fat**

**Progressive loss of lean body mass**

**Profound weakness**

**Anorexia**

**Anemia**

# Cachexia

- **Correlation between**

  - **Size and extent of spread of the cancer**
  - **Severity of the cachexia**

- **In tumors;**

  - **Despite reduced food intake**
    - **Normally recognized as starvation**
  - **Calorie expenditure remains high**
  - **Basal metabolic rate is increased**

- **Cachexia is NOT caused by the nutritional demands of the tumor**

- **Cytokines produced by the tumor and the host, rather than reduced
  food intake**

- **TNF**

  - **Produced by macrophages in response to tumor cells**
  - **Tumor cells themselves mediates cachexia**

- **TNF**

  - **Suppresses appetite**
  - **Inhibits the action of lipoprotein lipase**
  - **Inhibiting the release of free fatty acids from lipoproteins**

- **Proteolysis-inducing factor**

  - **A protein-mobilizing factor**
  - **Causes breakdown of skeletal muscle proteins by the
    ubiquitin-proteosome pathway**

- **No satisfactory treatment for cancer cachexia other than removal of
  the tumor**

# Paraneoplastic Syndromes

- **Symptom complexes that cannot be explained by local or distant
  spread of the tumor**
- **The secretion of unexpected hormone**
- **Important to recognize:**
  - **Earliest manifestation of an occult neoplasm**
  - **Significant clinical illness and may even be lethal.**
  - **May mimic metastatic disease, changing treatment**

![](img%5CClinicopathological-features-of-Neoplasia-and-Epidemiology4.png)

**Hypercalcemia due to bone metastasis is not considered as
paraneoplastic**

**If hypercalcemia is due to PTH related protein then it is a
paraneoplastic syndrome**

**Molecular Profiling of Tumors**

**Expression Profiling**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Molecular Profiling of Tumors

- **Whole Genome Sequencing**
- **Tumors can contain from a handful of somatic mutations**
  - **Certain childhood leukemias**
- **Tens of thousands of mutations**
  - **Exposed to mutagens, skin, lung cancer**

# Two types of mutations

- **Driver mutations **
  - **change normal control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and
    homeostasis**
  - **drive the neoplastic process**
  - **could be therapeutic targets**
- **Passenger mutations:**
  - **no effect on cell phenotype**
  - **more numerous than driver mutations**
  - **noncoding regions of the genome**
  - **have a neutral effect on growth, not conferring any advantage or
    disadvantage**

# Driver mutations

- **Recurrent**
  - **Present in a substantial percentage of patients with a particular
    cancer**
  - **BCR-ABL fusion genes**
- **Driver mutations may be present in only a subset of tumors of a
  particular type**
  - **4% of non–small cell lung cancers harbor an EML4-ALK tyrosine
    kinase fusion**
  - **Respond well to ALK inhibitors**

# Cancer Rates changes over time

- **Significant increase in the overall cancer death rate among men**
  - **Lung cancer, begun to drop**
- **The overall death rate among women has fallen slightly**
  - **Decline in death rates for cancers of the uterine cervix, stomach,
    and large bowel**
  - **Striking climb in the rate of lung cancer in women**

# Geographic and Environmental Variables

- **Environmental factors are the predominant cause of the most common
  sporadic cancers**
- **Geographic differences in death rates from specific forms of
  cancer**
  - **Breast cancer**
    - **4-5x higher in the United States and Europe than in Japan**
  - **Stomach carcinoma**
    - **7x higher in Japan than in the United States**
  - **Liver cell carcinoma**
    - **Relatively infrequent in the United States**
    - **Most lethal cancer among African populations**
- **Environmental factors are the predominant cause of the most common
  sporadic cancers**
- **These geographic differences are environmental rather than genetic
  in origin**
  - **Nisei (second-generation Japanese living in the United States)**
  - **Have mortality rates for certain forms of cancer that are
    intermediate between those in natives of Japan and in Americans who
    have lived in the United States for many generations**
  - **The two rates come closer with each passing generation**

# Environmental carcinogens are everywhere

**In the workplace, in food, and in personal practices**

**Sunlight**

**Asbestos**

**Certain occupation**

**Certain features of diet**

**Cigarette smoking**

**Chronic alcohol consumption**

**Age at first intercourse**

**Number of sex partners**

- **There is no escape**
  - **Everything people do to earn a livelihood, to subsist, or to enjoy
    life turns out to be illegal, immoral, or fattening, or—most
    disturbing—possibly carcinogenic.**

# ?questions to think?

**Why do we see cancer in older people?**

**Why do we see cancer in newborns?**

**Why certain cancers have peaks at certain ages?**

# Age

- **Most cancer deaths occur between ages 55 and 75**
- **The rate declines, along with the population base, after age 75**
- **The rising incidence with age**
  - **Accumulation of somatic mutations**
  - **The decline in immune competence**
- **Cancer causes slightly more than 10% of all deaths among children
  younger than 15 years**
- **The major lethal cancers in children**
  - **Leukemias**
  - **CNS tumors**
  - **Lymphomas**
  - **Soft tissue and bone sarcomas**

# Heredity

![](img%5CClinicopathological-features-of-Neoplasia-and-Epidemiology39.png)

![](img%5CClinicopathological-features-of-Neoplasia-and-Epidemiology40.png)

- **Inheritance of a single mutant gene greatly increases the risk of
  developing a tumor**
- **Carriers of mutant Rb have a 10,000-fold increased risk of
  developing retinoblastoma**
- **Often are associated with a specific marker phenotype**
  - **Polyps in APC**
  - **Lisch nodules and café-au-lait spots in neurofibromatosis type 1**

![](img%5CClinicopathological-features-of-Neoplasia-and-Epidemiology41.png)

**characterized by chromosomal or DNA instability and high rates of
certain cancers**

![](img%5CClinicopathological-features-of-Neoplasia-and-Epidemiology42.png)

- **Features that characterize familial cancers**
  - **Early age at onset**
  - **Tumors arising in two or more close relatives of the index case**
  - **Multiple or bilateral tumors**
- **Familial cancers**
  - **Not associated with specific marker phenotypes**
  - **In contrast to APC, familial colonic cancers do not arise in
    preexisting benign polyps**
- **Incomplete penetrance or multifactorial inheritance**

# Why all smokers do not get cancer?

**Polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes**

**Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in lung cancer**

**Identified variants in a nicotinic acid receptor**

**Associated with the number of cigarettes smoked**

**Indirectly increase lung cancer risk by enhancing the addictiveness of
cigarettes**

**?My uncle used to smoke 3 packages per day, he did not get cancer?**

# Acquired Preneoplastic Lesions

- **Preneoplastic lesions, precancers**
- **Precursor lesions arise in the setting of chronic tissue injury or
  inflammation**
- **Squamous metaplasia and dysplasia of the bronchial mucosa**
  - **Habitual smokers**
  - **A risk factor for lung cancer**
- **Endometrial hyperplasia and dysplasia**
  - **Women with unopposed estrogenic stimulation**
  - **A risk factor for endometrial carcinoma**
- **Leukoplakia of the oral cavity, vulva, or penis**
  - **May progress to squamous cell carcinoma**
- **Villous adenomas of the colon**
  - **Associated with a high risk of transformation to colorectal
    carcinoma**

# What is the risk of malignant change in a benign neoplasm?

- **Are benign tumors precancerous?**
  - **Adenomas of the colon as they enlarge can undergo malignant
    transformation in 50% of cases**
  - **Malignant change is extremely rare in leiomyomas of the uterus**

# Early Detection of Cancer

- **Screening Tests**
  - **Hormone Markers**
- **PAP Test**
- **HPV Test**
