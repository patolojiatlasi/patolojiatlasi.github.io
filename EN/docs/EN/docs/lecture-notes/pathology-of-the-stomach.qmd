# Pathology of the Stomach

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Stomach

* __Cardia__
  * __Lined mainly by mucin\-secreting foveolar cells that form small glands__
* __Antrum__
  * __Similar to cardia__
  * __Contain endocrine cells__
  * __G cells release gastrin to stimulate luminal acid secretion by parietal cells within the gastric fundus and body__
* __Body\, funds__
  * __Glands contain chief cells__
  * __Produce and secrete digestive enzymes\, pepsin__

* __Mechanisms protect the gastric mucosa__
  * __Mucin secreted by surface foveolar cells__
