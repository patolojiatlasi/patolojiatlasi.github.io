# Transmission and Dissemination of Microbes

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# How microbes enter body?

__Microbes enter the body if they overcome the natural barriers and defense mechanisms__

# Natural barriers

__Intact Skin__

__Mucosa__

__Blood Brain Barrier__

__Natural barriers are physical barriers and produce antimicrobial substances__

# Defense mechanisms

__Saliva__

__Tear__

__sIgA__

__Peyer’s patches__

# Routes of Entry of Microbes

__Breaches in the skin__

__Inhalation__

__Ingestion__

__Sexual transmission__

# Infections occur in otherwise healthy persons

* __Respiratory\, gastrointestinal\, or genitourinary tract infections__

# SKIN

![](./img-local/Transmission-and-Dissemination-of-Microbes1.png)

# Skin

* __Dense\, keratinized outer layer__
