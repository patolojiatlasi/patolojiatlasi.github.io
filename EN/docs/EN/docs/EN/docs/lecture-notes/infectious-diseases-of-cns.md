# Infectious Diseases of CNS

- **Agents specific for CNS**
  - **Rabies**
- **Other agents**
  - **Staphylococcus aureus**
- **Damage to nervous tissue**
  - **direct injury of neurons or glial cells by the infectious agent or
    microbial toxins**
  - **consequence of the host innate or adaptive immune response**

# How do infectious agents reach the nervous system

- **Hematogenous spread**
  - **Arterial blood supply**
    - **The most common means of entry**
  - **Retrograde venous spread**
    - **Anastomoses between veins of the face**
    - **Venous sinuses of the skull**
- **Direct implantation of microorganisms**
  - **Traumatic introduction of foreign material**
  - **Iatrogenic**
    - **Lumbar puncture needle**
- **Local extension**
  - **Infections of the skull or spine**
  - **Air sinuses**
    - **Most often the mastoid or frontal**

# Subdural Infections

- **Subdural empyema**
  - **When infections of the skull or air sinuses spread to the subdural
    space**
  - **Arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces are unaffected**
  - **Large subdural empyema may produce a mass effect**
- **Thrombophlebitis in the bridging veins that cross the subdural
  space**
  - **Venous occlusion**
  - **Infarction of the brain**

# Meningitis

- **Inflammatory process involving the leptomeninges within the
  subarachnoid space**
- **Meningoencephalitis**
  - **If spreads into the underlying brain**
- **Meningitis can be infectious or chemical**
- **Infectious meningitis**
  - **acute pyogenic (usually bacterial)**
  - **aseptic (usually viral)**
  - **chronic (usually tuberculous, spirochetal, or cryptococcal)**

# Acute Pyogenic Meningitis (Bacterial Meningitis)

  - **Escherichia coli, group B streptococci**
- **Adolescents and in young adults**
  - **Neisseria meningitidis**
- **Older individuals**
  - **Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes**

**Acute meningitis**

**Exudate is within the leptomeninges over the surface of the brain**

**Meningeal vessels are engorged and prominent**

**Tracts of pus can be followed along blood vessels on the brain
surface**

**When the meningitis is fulminant**

**-inflammatory cells infiltrate the walls of the leptomeningeal veins**

**-may spread into the substance of the brain (focal cerebritis)**

**-may extend to the ventricles, producing ventriculitis**

- **The agent in prion diseases is an abnormal form of a cellular
  protein**
  - **Prion protein (PrP)**
- **May undergo a conformational change from its normal shape (PrP c )
  to an abnormal conformation called PrP sc ( sc for scrapie)**
- **PrP normally is rich in α-helices, but PrP sc has a high content of
  β-sheets**
  - **a characteristic that makes it resistant to proteolysis**
- **When PrP sc physically interacts with PrP molecules it induces them
  to also adopt the PrP sc conformation**
  - **“infectious nature” of PrP sc**
- **Over time accumulation of a high burden of pathogenic PrP sc
  molecules in the brain**

![](img%5CInfectious-Diseases-of-CNS19.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Sporadic cases of prion disease (sCJD)

**PrP c also may change its conformation spontaneously**

**Extremely low rate **

# Early-onset familial forms of prion disease (fCJD)

**Certain mutations in the gene encoding PrP c ( PRNP ) accelerate the
rate of spontaneous conformational change**

![](img%5CInfectious-Diseases-of-CNS20.png)

**α-Helical PrPc may spontaneously shift to the β-sheet PrPsc
conformation, an event that occurs at a much higher rate in familial
disease associated with germ line PrP mutations**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CInfectious-Diseases-of-CNS21.png)

**PrPsc may also be from exogenous sources, such as contaminated food,
medical instrumentation, or medicines. Once present, PrPsc converts
additional molecules of PrPc into PrPsc through physical interaction**

# Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease

- **Rapidly progressive dementing illness**
- **Sporadic in approximately 85% of cases**
- **Worldwide annual incidence of about 1 per million**
- **\>70 years of age**
- **Familial forms caused by mutations in PRNP may present in younger
  people**
- **The progression to death in CJD usually is so rapid**
  - **little macroscopic evidence of brain atrophy**

![](img%5CInfectious-Diseases-of-CNS23.png)

**Pathognomonic finding is a spongiform transformation of the cerebral
cortex and deep gray matter structures (caudate, putamen)**

**Uneven formation of small, apparently empty, microscopic vacuoles of
varying sizes within the neuropil and sometimes in the perikaryon of
neurons**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Advanced cases**

**Severe neuronal loss**

**Reactive gliosis**

**Expansion of the vacuolated areas into cystlike spaces (“status
spongiosus”)**

**No inflammatory infiltrate is present**

**Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the presence of proteinase
K–resistant PrP sc in tissue**

**Western blotting of tissue extracts after partial protease digestion
allows detection of diagnostic PrP sc .**

# Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease

- **Starting in 1995, cases of a CJD-like illness appeared in the United
  Kingdom**
- **Neuropathologic findings and molecular features of these new cases
  were similar to those of CJD**
- **This new disorder differed from typical CJD in several important
  respects**
  - **The disease affected young adults**
  - **Behavioral disorders figured prominently in early disease stages**
  - **Neurologic syndrome progressed more slowly than in other forms of
    CJD**
- **Consequence of exposure to the prion disease of cattle, called
  bovine spongiform encephalopathy**
- **Transmission by blood transfusion**
- **Similar pathologic appearance to that in other types of CJD**
  - **spongiform change**
  - **absence of inflammation**
- **In vCJD, however, there are abundant cortical amyloid plaques,
  surrounded by the spongiform change**

![](img%5CInfectious-Diseases-of-CNS24.png)

**Variant CJD (vCJD) is characterized by amyloid plaques (see inset)
that sit in the regions of greatest spongiform change**
