# CNS Tumors

- **Annual incidence of CNS tumors**
  - **10-17/100,000 persons intracranial tumors**
  - **1-2/100,000 persons for intraspinal tumors**
- **1/2-2/3 primary tumors**
- **Rest are metastatic**
- **20% of all pediatric tumors**
  - **likely to arise in the posterior fossa**
  - **in adults, mostly supratentorial**

# Characteristics of CNS tumors

- **Do not have detectable premalignant or in situ stages like
  carcinomas**
- **Low-grade lesions may infiltrate large regions of the brain**
  - **serious clinical deficits, nonresectability, and poor prognosis**
- **Anatomic site of the neoplasm influence outcome independent of
  histologic classification**
  - **local mass effects**
    - **benign meningioma may cause cardiorespiratory arrest from
      compression of the medulla**
  - **Nonresectability**
    - **brain stem gliomas**
- **Even the most highly malignant gliomas rarely spread outside of the
  CNS**
  - **Local infiltration**
  - **Spread in subarachnoid space**

# CNS Tumors

- **Tumors of the CNS may arise from**
- **Cells of the coverings**
  - **meningiomas**
- **The brain**
  - **gliomas, neuronal tumors, choroid plexus tumors**
- **Other CNS cell populations**
  - **primary CNS lymphoma, germ cell tumors**
- **Elsewhere in the body**
  - **metastases**

# The most important feature for differential diagnosis

**Localization, localization, localization …**

**Age**

**Radiologic features**

**Histomorphologic features**

**Genetic features**

# Localisation of CNS tumors

- **Distinct types of tumors affect specific brain regions**
  - **Cerebellum → medulloblastoma**
  - **Intraventricular location → Central neurocytoma**
- **Specific age populations**
  - **Pediatric age → medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytomas**
  - **Older patients → glioblastoma, lymphoma**

# Spread of CNS tumors

**Metastatic spread of brain tumors to other regions of the body is
rare**

**Spinal subarachnoid tumor seeding**

# Grading of CNS tumors

**Grading is based on histological subtype**

**Grade I tumors**

**Grade II tumors**

**Grade III tumors**

**Grade IV tumors**

**Benign, Resection is cure**

**Progression can be seen**

# GLIOMAS

- **Most common types are highly infiltrative or “diffuse gliomas”**
  - **astrocytic, oligodendroglial, and mixed forms**
- **Ependymomas form solid masses**

# Grading of CNS gliomas

**Increasing tumor malignancy is associated with more cytologic
anaplasia, increased cell density, necrosis, and mitotic activity**

**Grade I tumors**

**Grade II tumors**

**Grade III tumors**

**Grade IV tumors**
