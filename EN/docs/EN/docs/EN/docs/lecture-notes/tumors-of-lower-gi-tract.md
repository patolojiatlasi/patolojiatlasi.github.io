# Polyps

- **Most common in the colon**
- **May occur in the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine**
- **Most common neoplastic polyp is the adenoma**
- **Non-neoplastic colonic polyps**
  - **inflammatory, hamartomatous, hyperplastic**

**Those without stalks are referred to as sessile**

**As sessile polyps enlarge, proliferation of cells adjacent to the
polyp and the effects of traction on the luminal protrusion, may combine
to create a stalk**

**Polyps with stalks are termed pedunculated**

# Inflammatory Polyps

- **Chronic cycles of injury and healing produce a polypoid mass made up
  of inflamed and reactive mucosal tissue**
- **Polyp that forms as part of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome**
  - **Clinical triad of rectal bleeding, mucus discharge, and an
    inflammatory lesion of the anterior rectal wall**
  - **Impaired relaxation of the anorectal sphincter**

# Hamartomatous Polyps

**Occur sporadically**

**Components of various genetically determined or acquired syndromes**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Juvenile Polyps

- **Most common type of hamartomatous polyp**
- **Children \<5 years of age**
- **Located in the rectum**
- **Rectal bleeding, prolapse**
- **Sporadic juvenile polyps are usually solitary**
- **Autosomal dominant syndrome of juvenile polyposis 3-100 polyps**
- **Colectomy may be required**
- **Dysplasia occurs in a small proportion (mostly
  syndrome-associated)**
  - **Juvenile polyposis syndrome is associated with increased risk for
    the development of colonic adenocarcinoma**
- **Mucosal hyperplasia, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)**

**Pedunculated, smooth-surfaced, reddish lesions**

**\<3 cm**

**Cystic spaces on cut sections**

**Dilated glands filled with mucin and inflammatory debris**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome

**Rare autosomal dominant disorder**

**Presence of multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and
mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation**

**Increased risk of several malignancies, colon, pancreas, breast, lung,
ovaries, uterus, and testes**

**Germ line heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene
LKB1/STK11 are present in approximately half of the patients with the
familial and subset of sporadic form**

**Intestinal polyps are most common in the small intestine, may also
occur in the stomach and colon, rarely, in the bladder and lungs**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract11.png)

**Large and pedunculated**

**Lobulated contour**

**Arborizing network of connective tissue, smooth muscle, lamina
propria, and glands lined by normal-appearing intestinal epithelium**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract12.png)

**Peutz-Jeghers polyp. Complex glandular architecture and bundles of
smooth muscle help to distinguish Peutz-Jeghers polyps from juvenile
polyps.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Hyperplastic Polyps

**Common epithelial proliferations**

**Sixth and seventh decades of life**

**Decreased epithelial cell turnover and delayed shedding of surface
epithelial cells, leading to a “pileup” of goblet cells**

**No malignant potential, must be distinguished from sessile serrated
adenomas**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract13.png)

**Most commonly found in the left colon**

**Less than 5 mm in diameter**

**Smooth, nodular protrusions of the mucosa**

**Frequently multiple, in the sigmoid colon and rectum**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract14.png)

**Polyp surface with irregular tufting of epithelial cells**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract15.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Tufting results from epithelial overcrowding**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract16.png)

**Epithelial crowding produces a serrated architecture when glands are
cut in cross-section**

# Adenoma

**Neoplastic mass lesion in the GI tract**

**Produce a mucosal protrusion, or polyp**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Epithelial dysplasia**

**Small, often pedunculated polyps to large sessile lesions**

**No gender predilection**

**50% of adults living in the Western world beginning age 50**

**Precursors to colorectal cancer**

**Surveillance colonoscopy**

**Tubular adenoma with a smooth surface and rounded glands**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract20.jpg)

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract21.png)

**Villous adenoma with long, slender projections that are reminiscent of
small intestinal villi**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract22.png)

**The cytologic hallmark of epithelial dysplasia is nuclear
hyperchromasia, elongation, and stratification**

**Changes are most easily appreciated at the surface of the adenoma,
because the epithelium fails to mature as cells migrate out of the
crypt**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract23.png)

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract24.png)

**Sessile serrated adenoma**

**Lined by goblet cells without typical cytologic features of dysplasia.
This lesion is distinguished from a hyperplastic polyp by involvement of
the crypts**

**Most common in the right colon**

**Have a malignant potential similar to that of traditional adenomas**

# Familial Adenomatous Polyps

**Autosomal dominant disorder**

**Numerous colorectal adenomas by the teenage years**

**Mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene ( APC )**

**\>100 polyps is necessary for a diagnosis of classic FAP, and as many
as several thousand may be present**

**Except for their remarkable numbers, these growths are morphologically
indistinguishable from sporadic adenomas**

**Colorectal adenocarcinoma develops in 100% of patients with untreated
FAP, often before age 30**

**Prophylactic colectomy**

**Neoplasia at other sites**

- **Gardner syndrome**
  - **osteomas of mandible, skull, and long bones**
  - **epidermal cysts**
  - **desmoid and thyroid tumors**
  - **dental abnormalities, including unerupted and supernumerary
    teeth**
- **Turcot syndrome**
  - **rarer**
  - **intestinal adenomas and tumors of the central nervous system**
  - **Two thirds of patients with Turcot syndrome have APC gene
    mutations and develop medulloblastomas**
  - **One third have mutations in one of several genes involved in DNA
    repair and develop glioblastomas**
- **Patients who have FAP without APC loss have mutations of the base
  excision repair gene MUTYH **

# Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer

- **Lynch syndrome**
- **Familial clustering of cancers at several sites including the
  colorectum, endometrium, stomach, ovary, ureters, brain, small bowel,
  hepatobiliary tract, and skin**
- **Colon cancers tend to occur at younger ages than for sporadic colon
  cancers and often are located in the right colon**
- **Inherited germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes**
  - **MSH2 or MLH1**
  - **HNPCC inherit one mutated DNA repair gene and one normal allele**
  - **When the second copy is lost through mutation or epigenetic
    silencing, defects in mismatch repair lead to the accumulation of
    mutations at rates up to 1000 times higher than normal**
  - **Regions containing short repeating DNA sequences referred to as
    microsatellite DNA**

# Adenocarcinoma of Colon

- **Most common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract**
- **Major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide**
- **Small intestine, which accounts for 75% of the overall length of the
  gastrointestinal tract, is an uncommon site for benign and malignant
  tumors. Nearly 15% of all cancer-related deaths, second only to lung
  cancer**
- **Incidence**
  - **Peaks at 60 to 70 years of age, and less than 20% of cases occur
    before age 50**
  - **Males are affected slightly more often than females**
  - **Most prevalent in the United States, Canada, Australia, New
    Zealand, Denmark, Sweden, and other developed countries**
  - **30x lower in India, South America, and Africa**
  - **Japan incidence is increasing**
- **Low intake of unabsorbable vegetable fiber and high intake of
  refined carbohydrates and fat**
- **NSAID may have a protective effect**

# The APC/β-catenin pathway

**The classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence**

**80% of sporadic colon tumors**

**Involves mutation of the APC tumor suppressor early in the neoplastic
process**

**Both copies of the APC gene must be functionally inactivated, either
by mutation or epigenetic events, for adenomas to develop**

**No APC is present**

**β-Catenin is active independent of WNT status**

**WNT signal inhibits APC**

**β-Catenin enters nucleus**

**APC is active**

**β-Catenin is dectructed**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract32.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**β-Catenin is active in the nucleus**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract33.png)

**cyclin D1 and MYC transcribed for proliferation**

**TWIST and SLUG are expressed**

**They repress E-cadherin expression**

**Reduce contact inhibition**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**TP53 ?? 70% to 80% of colon cancers but is uncommonly affected in
adenomas**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract34.png)

**KRAS**

**10% in \<1cm**

**50% \>1cm**

**50% in adenocarcinoma**

**SMAD2 and SMAD4, which are effectors of TGF-β signaling, normally
inhibits cell cycle **

**Loss of function TP53 and others caused by chromosomal deletions,
chromosomal instability in this pathway**

**Epigenetics**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# The microsatellite instability pathway

**DNA mismatch repair deficiency**

**Due to loss of mismatch repair genes**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract35.png)

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract36.png)

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract37.png)

- **Mutations accumulate in microsatellite repeats → microsatellite
  instability**
  - **Microsatellites typically are located in noncoding regions**
  - **Microsatellite sequences located in the coding or promoter regions
    of genes involved in regulation of cell growth**
    - **type II TGF-β receptor, uncontrolled growth**
    - **pro-apoptotic protein BAX, survival of abnormal clones**

![](img%5CTumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract38.png)

**Mutations in the oncogene BRAF and silencing of distinct groups of
genes due to CpG island hypermethylation also are common in cancers that
develop through DNA mismatch repair defects.**

**KRAS and TP53 typically are not mutated.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Adenocarcinoma distribution

- **Distributed approximately equally over the entire length of the
  colon**
- **Proximal colon**
  - **polypoid, exophytic masses**
  - **that extend along one wall of the large-caliber cecum and
    ascending colon**
  - **rarely cause obstruction**
- **Distal colon**
  - **annular lesions that produce “napkin ring” constrictions and
    luminal narrowing**
  - **point of obstruction**

**A: Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Note the elongated,
hyperchromatic nuclei. Necrotic debris, present in the gland lumen, is
typical.**

# Tumors of the Appendix

- **NET (Carcinoid)**
  - **Most common tumor**
  - **Usually discovered incidentally**
  - **Distal tip of the appendix**
- **Low grade appendicial mucinous neoplasm**
  - **Mucocele**
  - **consequence of mucinous cystadenoma or mucinous
    cystadenocarcinoma**
  - **Invasion through the appendiceal wall can lead to intraperitoneal
    seeding and spread. In women, the resulting peritoneal implants may
    be mistaken for mucinous ovarian tumors**
  - **Pseudomyxoma peritonei**
