# Embolus

- **intravascular solid, liquid, or gaseous mass**
- **carried by the blood to a site distant from its point of origin**
- **emboli derive from a dislodged thrombus**
  - **thromboembolism**
- **fat droplets**
- **bubbles of air or nitrogen**
- **atherosclerotic debris (cholesterol emboli)**
- **tumor fragments**
- **bone marrow**
- **amniotic fluid**

**emboli lodge in vessels too small to permit further passage**

**partial or complete vascular occlusion**

**ischemic necrosis (infarction)**

**embolization in the pulmonary circulation leads to hypoxia,
hypotension, and right-sided heart failure**

# Pulmonary Thromboembolism

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **A major cause of hospital deaths**

- **Venous emboli**

- **Originate from thrombi within deep leg veins**

  - **proximal to the popliteal fossa**
  - **lower leg thrombi is uncommon**

- **Paradoxical embolism**

- **Fragmented thrombi from DVTs**

- **Pass through the right side of the heart**

- **Pulmonary vasculature**

- **Depending on size occlude**

  - **main pulmonary artery**
  - **bifurcation of the right and left pulmonary arteries (saddle
    embolus)**
  - **smaller, branching arterioles**

**Can be multiple**

**Sequentially**

**Multiple places at the same time**

**Patient has increased risk if had one PTE**

**60-80% are small and clinically silent**

**Undergo organization, incorporated into the vascular wall**

**In some cases, organization of thromboemboli, bridging fibrous webs**

**A large embolus that blocks a major pulmonary artery can cause sudden
death**

- **Embolic obstruction of medium-sized arteries → subsequent rupture of
  capillaries → pulmonary hemorrhage**
- **Does not cause pulmonary infarction**
- **Intact bronchial circulation (dual circulation)**
- **A similar embolus in the setting of left-sided cardiac failure**
  - **lead to a pulmonary infarct**

**Embolism to small end-arteriolar pulmonary branches usually causes
infarction**

**Multiple emboli occurring over time can cause pulmonary hypertension
and right ventricular failure (cor pulmonale)**

# Systemic Thromboembolism

- **80% arise from intracardiac mural thrombi**

- **2/3 associated with left ventricular infarcts**

- **25% with dilated left atria (secondary to mitral valve disease)**

- **Remainder**

  - **aortic aneurysms**
  - **thrombi overlying ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques**
  - **fragmented valvular vegetations**
  - **venous system (paradoxical emboli)**

- **10% to 15% of systemic emboli are of unknown origin**

- **Common arteriolar embolization sites**

  - **lower extremities (75%)**
  - **central nervous system**
  - **intestines**
  - **kidneys**
  - **spleen**

- **consequences depend on**

  - **caliber of the occluded vessel**
  - **collateral supply**
  - **affected tissue’s vulnerability to anoxia**

# Fat embolism

- **Soft tissue crush injury**
  - **rupture of marrow vascular sinusoids (long bone fracture)**
  - **releases microscopic fat globules into the circulation**
- **Fat, marrow emboli are common after vigorous cardiopulmonary
  resuscitation**
  - **Little clinical consequence**
  - **Fat and marrow embolism occurs in some 90% of individuals with
    severe skeletal injuries**
  - **Less than 10% show any clinical findings**

# Fat embolism syndrome

- **pulmonary insufficiency**
- **neurologic symptoms**
- **anemia**
- **thrombocytopenia**
- **diffuse petechial rash**
- **fatal in 10% of cases**
- **1 to 3 days after injury sudden onset of**
  - **tachypnea**
  - **dyspnea**
  - **tachycardia**
  - **irritability**
  - **restlessness**
  - **delirium or coma**
- **Pathogenesis**
- **Fat microemboli occlude pulmonary and cerebral microvasculature**
  - **directly and by triggering platelet aggregation**
- **Fatty acid release from lipid globules**
  - **Local toxic endothelial injury**
  - **Platelet activation and granulocyte recruitment**

# Amniotic Fluid Embolism

- **Uncommon**

- **Complication of labor**

- **Immediate postpartum period (1 in 40,000 deliveries)**

- **Mortality rate 80%**

  - **Most common cause of maternal death in the developed world**

- **85% of survivors suffer some form of permanent neurologic deficit**

- **Underlying cause**

- **entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation**

  - **via tears in the placental membranes**

- **uterine vein rupture**

- **Onset is sudden**

  - **severe dyspnea**
  - **cyanosis**
  - **hypotensive shock**
  - **seizures and coma**

- **If acute phase is survived**

  - **pulmonary edema**
  - **disseminated intravascular coagulation**
    - **secondary to release of thrombogenic substances from amniotic
      fluid**

- **Histologic analysis in the maternal pulmonary microcirculation**

  - **squamous cells shed from fetal skin**
  - **lanugo hair**
  - **fat from vernix caseosa**
  - **mucin derived from the fetal respiratory or gastrointestinal
    tracts**

- **Other findings**

  - **marked pulmonary edema**
  - **diffuse alveolar damage**
  - **systemic fibrin thrombi**
    - **disseminated intravascular coagulation**

# Air Embolism

- **Gas bubbles obstruct vascular flow**
- **Cause distal ischemic injury**
- **Can occur during surgery**
- **Small venous gas emboli generally have no deleterious effects**
- **Sufficient air can enter the pulmonary circulation **
  - **during obstetric procedures**
  - **chest wall injury to cause hypoxia**
- **Very large venous emboli may arrest in the heart and cause death**

# Decompression sickness,

- **Scuba divers, underwater construction workers, and persons in
  unpressurized aircraft who undergo rapid ascent**
- **Caisson disease**
  - **recurrent or persistent gas emboli in the bones lead to multifocal
    ischemic necrosis**
- **High-pressure chamber**

# INFARCTION

# Infarction

- **An area of ischemic necrosis**
- **Caused by occlusion of the vascular supply to the affected tissue**
- **A major cause of death**
  - **myocardial infarction**
  - **cerebral infarction**
  - **pulmonary infarction**
  - **bowel infarction**
  - **ischemic necrosis of distal extremities (gangrene)**
    - **diabetic patients**

# Causes of infarction

- **Arterial thrombosis**
- **Arterial embolism**
- **Vasospasm**
- **Expansion of an atheroma secondary to intraplaque hemorrhage**
- **Extrinsic compression of a vessel**
  - **by tumor**
- **Dissecting aortic aneurysm**
- **Edema within a confined space**
  - **in anterior tibial compartment syndrome**
- **Vessel twisting**
  - **in testicular torsion or bowel volvulus**
- **Traumatic vascular rupture**
- **Entrapment in a hernia sac**

**Venous thrombosis can cause infarction too**

**But the more common outcome is simply congestion**

**Bypass channels rapidly open to provide arterial inflow**

**Infarcts caused by venous thrombosis occur only in organs with a
single efferent vein (testis or ovary)**

# Infarcts

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# White infarcts

![](./img-local/Embolism%2C-Infarction-and-Shock11.png)

- **Arterial occlusions in solid organs with end-arterial circulations**
  - **heart, spleen, and kidney**
- **tissue density limits the blood from adjoining patent vascular
  beds**
- **Wedge-shaped**
  - **Occluded vessel at the apex**
  - **Organ periphery forming the base**
  - **When the base is a serosal surface, there is often an overlying
    fibrinous exudate**
  - **Lateral margins may be irregular**
    - **Reflecting flow from adjacent vessels**

**Margins of acute infarcts typically are indistinct and slightly
hemorrhagic**

**With time, the edges become better defined**

# Ischemic coagulative necrosis

- **An inflammatory response develop at the margins of infarcts**
  - **Few hours, well defined within 1-2 days**
- **Repair**
  - **Beginning in the preserved margins**
  - **Parenchymal regeneration or scar**
  - **In CNS → liquefactive necrosis**

**Kidney infarct, replaced by a large fibrotic scar**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Septic infarctions

**Infected cardiac valve vegetations embolize**

**When microbes seed necrotic tissue, infarct is converted into an
abscess**

# Factors That Influence Infarct Development

- **The anatomy of the vascular supply**
- **The time over which the occlusion develops**
  - **Collateral circulation**
- **The intrinsic vulnerability of the affected tissue to ischemic
  injury**
- **The blood oxygen content**

# SHOCK

# Shock

**final common pathway for several potentially lethal events**

**extensive trauma or burns**

**myocardial infarction**

**pulmonary embolism**

**sepsis**

**Shock is characterized by systemic hypoperfusion of tissues**

**can be caused by diminished cardiac output**

**reduced effective circulating blood volume**

**impaired tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia**

**initially is reversible, prolonged shock often fatal**

# The most common forms of shock

- **Cardiogenic shock**
  - **Low cardiac output due to myocardial pump failure**
- **Hypovolemic shock**
  - **Loss of blood or plasma volume**
- **Septic shock**

# Septic Shock

- **Gram-positive bacteria constitute the most common cause of septic
  shock, followed by gram-negative organisms and fungi**
- **Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)**
  - **When there is no microorganism product**
- **Coagulation is also affected**
