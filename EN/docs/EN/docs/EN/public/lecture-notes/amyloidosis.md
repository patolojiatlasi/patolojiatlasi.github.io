# Amyloidosis

- **Deposit, accumulation of fibrillar proteins**
- **Causes are many inherited and inflammatory disorders**
- **Extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins**
  - **responsible for tissue damage and functional compromise**
  - **Misfolded proteins or protein fragments, normally soluble
    accumulate**
    - **Abnormal fibrils**

# Amyloid: Amylose (starch) like

- **The fibrillar deposits bind**
  - **proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans**
  - **heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate**
  - **plasma proteins**
  - **serum amyloid P component (SAP)**
- **These charged sugar groups cause staining characteristics resemble
  starch → That is why they are called amyloid**

# PATHOGENESIS OF AMYLOID DEPOSITION

# Amyloid

- **A disorder of protein misfolding**
- **Not a structurally homogeneous protein**
  - **more than 25 different protein**
- **But has same morphologic appearance**
  - **Composed of nonbranching fibrils**
  - **7.5 to 10 nm in diameter**
  - **Formed of β-sheet polypeptide chains**
  - **Congo red stain binds to these fibrils and produces a red–green
    birefringence**

**the traditional approaches to therapy focus on treating the underlying
disease—specifically, chemotherapy for myeloma (with AL amyloidosis) and
antibiotics for chronic infections or anti- inflammatory agents for
autoimmune diseases (with AA amyloidosis).**

**Some breakthroughs appear imminent, however: Building on an improved
understanding of protein folding, research has led to production of a
number of useful small molecules—so-called “amyloid breakers,” now
entering into clinical trial. Some of these interfere with the binding
of chaperone proteins such as substance P and apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4),
which can propagate the β-sheet content of Aβ peptides and promote
pathogenic fibril formation in the brain: CPHPC is a carboxypyrrolidinyl
carboxylic acid derivative that binds to the P component and results in
its prompt removal from the circulation thus eliminating an important
“nucleation factor” for amyloid propagation. Other agents such as
tramiprosate inhibit the interactions between interstitial
glycosaminoglycans and Aβ that normally stabilize fibril formation;
these breakers are sulfated glycosaminoglycan mimetics. Yet another
approach is to stabilize native transthyretin tetramers with drugs like
tafamadis or diflunisal to prevent the dissociation of monomeric
components (e.g., from mutant isoforms) that can then misfold into
amyloid fibrils.**

**With these approaches, coupled with earlier detection of amyloid
deposits before irreversible damage is done, what previously has been an
intractable and inexorable process may eventually become manageable.**
