# Cirrhosis

- **Diffuse process characterized by fibrosis and the conversion of
  normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal nodules**
- **Not focal but rather involve most (if not all) of the diseased
  liver**
- **Fibrous septa**
  - **delicate bands or broad scars around multiple adjacent lobules**
  - **Long-standing fibrosis generally is irreversible so long as
    disease persists or if disease-associated vascular shunts are
    widespread**
  - **regression is possible if the underlying cause of liver disease is
    reversed**
- **Parenchymal nodules**
  - **\<3 mm micronodules**
  - **\>1 cm macronodules**
  - **encircled by fibrous bands**
- **Hepatocytes in these nodules derive from:**
- **Preexistent, long-lived hepatocytes that, by the time cirrhosis is
  established, display features of replicative senescence**
- **Newly formed hepatocytes capable of replication that are derived
  from stem/progenitor cells found adjacent to the canals of Hering and
  small bile ductules—the hepatobiliary stem cell niche**
  - **also give rise to the ductular reactions found at the periphery of
    most cirrhotic nodules, where parenchyma meets stromal scar, and are
    accompanied by proliferating endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and
    inflammatory cells**

**Death of hepatocytes**

**Extracellular matrix deposition**

**Vascular reorganization**

**Damaged hepatocytes or by stimulated Kupffer cells and sinusoidal
endothelial cells**

**Produce**

**Reactive oxygen species, growth factors, and cytokines such as tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and lymphotoxins**

**Activate**

**Perisinusoidal stellate cells**

**Produce**

**Growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β)**

**Their further proliferation and collagen synthesis**

**Portal fibroblasts also participate**

**Even in late-stage disease, if the disease process is halted or
eliminated, significant remodeling and even restoration of liver
function (cirrhotic regression) is possible**

- **Vascular injuries and changes**
- **Inflammation and thrombosis of portal veins, hepatic arteries,
  and/or central veins**
- **Alternating zones of parenchymal hypoperfusion**
- **Parenchymal atrophy, and hyperperfusion, with overcompensating
  regeneration**
- **Loss of sinusoidal endothelial cell fenestrations**
- **Portal vein–hepatic vein and hepatic artery–portal vein vascular
  shunts**
- **Fast-flowing vascular channels without solute exchange**
- **Loss of microvilli from the hepatocyte surface**
  - **diminishing its transport capacity**

# TUMORS AND HEPATIC NODULES

# Tumors and Hepatic Nodules

- **Most common hepatic neoplasms are metastatic carcinomas**
  - **Colon, lung, and breast as the primary sites**
- **Primary hepatic malignancies are almost all hepatocellular
  carcinomas**
- **Hepatoblastoma**
  - **childhood hepatocellular tumor**
- **Angiosarcoma**
  - **exposure to vinyl chloride and arsenic**

# BENIGN TUMORS

- **Cavernous hemangiomas**
  - **The most common benign lesion **
  - **Usually less than 2 cm in diameter, often directly beneath the
    capsule**
  - **Blind percutaneous needle biopsy may cause severe intra-abdominal
    bleeding**
- **Von Meyenburg complexes**
  - **congenital bile duct hamartomas**
  - **usually isolated or present in small numbers**
  - **bile duct–like structures separated by bland, densely collagenized
    stroma**
  - **No malignant potential**
  - **When multiple may indicate the presence of fibropolycystic disease
    of the liver, association with polycystic kidney disease**

**Von Meyenburg complex**

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

# Focal Nodular Hyperplasia

- **Found in otherwise normal livers**
- **Localized, well-demarcated, but poorly encapsulated lesion**
  - **Consisting of hyperplastic hepatocyte nodules**
  - **Central, stellate fibrous scar**
- **Not a true neoplasm**
  - **Represents a response to abnormal vascular flow through a
    congenital or acquired vascular anomaly that gives rise to
    alternating areas of parenchymal regeneration and atrophy**
- **May range in size from 1 cm to many centimeters across**
- **Usually is an incidental finding**
- **Most commonly in women of reproductive age**
  - **may grow in response to estrogens**
- **No risk for malignancy**
- **Cause symptoms by pressing on the liver capsule**

# Hepatic Adenoma

**Benign hepatocellular neoplasm**

**Occurs in women of child-bearing age**

**Oral contraceptive pills**

**Well-demarcated but unencapsulated tumors**

**Pale, yellow-tan, or bile-stained and up to 30 cm in diameter**

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms16.png)

**Hepatic adenoma.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Sheets and cords of cells**
- **Resemble normal hepatocytes**
  - **minimal variation in cell and nuclear size**
- **Portal tracts are absent**
- **Prominent arterial vessels and draining veins are distributed
  throughout**

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms17.png)

**B: Photomicrograph showing adenoma, with cords of normal-appearing
hepatocytes, absence of portal tracts, and prominent neovascularization
(asterisks). A large zone of infarcted tumor is present.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Also called as Liver cell adenomas**
- **Intrahepatic mass, mistaken for hepatocellular carcinoma**
- **Subcapsular adenomas are at risk for rupture**
  - **during pregnancy (under estrogenic stimulation)**
  - **life-threatening intraabdominal hemorrhage**
- **With β-catenin mutations carry a risk of developing into
  hepatocellular carcinoma**

# Hepatic Adenoma Types

- **Biallelic inactivation through somatic (90%) or germline (10%)
  mutations of either the HNF1A gene (encoding a hepatocyte
  transcription factor) or the CYP1B1 gene (encoding cytochrome P-450)**
  - **35-40%**
  - **Most common in women, sometimes associated with oral contraceptive
    use, and are often yellow from marked steatosis. They carry little
    risk for malignant transformation**
- **Activating mutations of β-catenin**
  - **10-15%**
  - **High risk for malignant transformation**
  - **Most common in men**
  - **May be related to anabolic steroid use and possibly nonalcoholic
    fatty liver disease**
- **Inflammatory**
  - **50%**
  - **Associated with increased expression of acute phase reactant
    proteins**
    - **serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein in the tumor and
      sometimes in the serum**
  - **10% of these tumors also have activating mutations of β-catenin
    and may undergo malignant transformation**
  - **Most common in women**
  - **Associated with obesity and fatty liver disease**
  - **Identical to FNH, and the distinction may be made by demonstrating
    an inflammatory phenotype (such as by expression of serum amyloid A
    protein, SAA)**

# PRECURSOR LESIONS OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA

# Precursor Lesions of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

- **Cellular changes and nodular lesions**
  - **Chronic liver disease**
    - **Chronic viral hepatitis**
    - **Alcoholic liver disease**
    - **Metabolic diseases**
      - **AAT deficiency**
      - **Hereditary hemochromatosis**
- **Cellular Dysplasia**
  - **common in the setting of chronic viral hepatitis**
- **Usually they are found in late-stage disease**
- **The processes that lead to cirrhosis and to malignant transformation
  usually take years to decades and run parallel to each other, rather
  than in sequence**
- **Hepatocellular adenomas**

# Large cell change

**Scattered hepatocytes**

**Periportal or periseptal regions**

**Larger than normal hepatocytes**

**Pleomorphic, often multiple nuclei**

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms18.png)

**A: Large cell change. Very large hepatocytes with very large, often
atypical nuclei are scattered among normal-size hepatocytes with round,
typical nuclei.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Small cell change

**Smaller than normal hepatocytes**

**Normal sized, often hyperchromatic, oval or angulated nuclei**

**May appear anywhere in the hepatic lobule**

**With formation of vaguely nodular clusters**

**Considered to be directly premalignant**

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms19.png)

**B: Small cell change (SCC). Normal-appearing hepatocytes are in the
lower right corner. SCC is indicated by smaller than normal hepatocytes
with thickened liver cell plates, and high nuclear : cytoplasmic **

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Dysplastic Nodules

**Major pathway to hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic liver disease**

**Most cirrhotic nodules range 0.3-0.8 cm**

**Dysplastic nodules often are 1- 2 cm**

**High risk for malignant transformation**

**Sometimes contain overtly malignant subnodules**

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms20.png)

**A: Hepatitis C–related cirrhosis with a distinctively large nodule
(arrows). Nodule-in-nodule growth in this dysplastic nodule suggests a
high grade lesion.**

**B: Histologically the region within the box in A shows a
well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (right side) and a
subnodule of moderately differentiated HCC within it (center, left).**

# HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMAS

# Hepatocellular Carcinomas

- **Infection with HBV or HCV, alcoholic cirrhosis, and aflatoxin
  exposure**
- **NAFLD, hemochromatosis, α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, tyrosinemia**
- **Many variables, including age, gender, chemicals, viruses, hormones,
  alcohol, and nutrition, interact in the development of HCC**
- **The disease most likely to give rise is hereditary tyrosinemia**
- **Japan and Central Europe, chronic HCV infection**
- **China and southern Africa, HBV is endemic**
  - **high-level exposure to dietary aflatoxins derived from the fungus
    Aspergillus flavus is also common**
  - **“moldy” grains and peanuts**
  - **Aflatoxin can bind covalently with cellular DNA, resulting in
    mutations in genes such as TP53**

**Tumors may arise from both mature hepatocytes and progenitor cells
(known as ductular cells or oval cells)**

**Grossly as**

**a unifocal, usually massive tumor**

**a multifocal tumor made of nodules of variable size**

**a diffusely infiltrative cancer, permeating widely and sometimes
involving the entire liver, blending imperceptibly into the cirrhotic
background**

**Discrete tumor masses usually are yellow-white, punctuated sometimes
by bile staining and areas of hemorrhage or necrosis**

**Strong propensity for vascular invasion**

**Extensive intrahepatic metastases are characteristic**

**Snakelike masses of tumor invade the portal vein (with occlusion of
the portal circulation) or inferior vena cava, extending even into the
right side of the heart**

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms22.png)

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

**Range from well-differentiated lesions that reproduce hepatocytes
arranged in cords, trabeculae or glandular patterns**

**To poorly differentiated lesions, often composed of large,
multinucleate anaplastic giant cells**

**Globules of bile may be found within the cytoplasm of cells and in
pseudocanaliculi between cells**

**Acidophilic hyaline inclusions within the cytoplasm may be present,
resembling Mallory bodies**

**There is little stroma in most hepatocellular carcinomas, explaining
their soft consistency**

# Fibrolamellar HCC

**Young male and female adults (20-40 years of age)**

**No association with cirrhosis or other risk factors**

**Single tumor with fibrous bands coursing through it**

**Superficially resembling focal nodular hyperplasia**

**Fibrolamellar variant has a better prognosis than that of the other,
more common variants**
