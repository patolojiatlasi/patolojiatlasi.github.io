# Inflammatory, Toxic, Alcoholic and Metabolic Diseases of Liver

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# DRUG- OR TOXIN-INDUCED LIVER DISEASE

# Drug- or Toxin-Induced Liver Disease

* __Liver is the major detoxifying organ__
* __Injury may result from;__
* __Direct toxicity__
* __Hepatic conversion of a xenobiotic to an active toxin__
* __By immune mechanisms__
  * __a drug or a metabolite acting as a hapten to convert a cellular protein into an immunogen__

* __Diagnosis depends on__
  * __Association of agent and liver injury in terms of time__
  * __Recovery on removal of the compound__
  * __Exclusion of other causes__
* __Should be in differential diagnosis list always__
* __Most important agent that produces toxic liver injury is alcohol__

# Drug-induced liver disease

* __Common condition__
* __May manifest as__
  * __A mild reaction__
  * __Acute liver failure__
  * __Chronic liver disease__
* __Caused by:__
  * __Drugs or medicines__
  * __Herbal remedies__
  * __Dietary supplements__
  * __Topical applications \(e\.g\.\, ointments\, perfumes\, shampoo\)__
  * __Environmental exposures \(e\.g\.\, cleaning solvents\, pesticides\, fertilizers\)__

# Drug reactions

* __Predictable__
  * __Dose\-dependent__
* __Unpredictable \(idiosyncratic\)__
  * __Individual host variations__
  * __Immune response to drug\-related antigen__
  * __The rate at which the agent is metabolized__
* __Both classes of injury may be immediate or take weeks to months to develop__

__Many drugs cause hepatic injury__

__For updated information __

# Predictable

* __Acetaminophen__
  * __Most common cause of acute liver failure necessitating transplantation in the United States__
  * __Intentional suicidal overdoses are common\, so are accidental overdoses__
  * __Codeine\, alcohol upregulate  P\-450 system → acetaminophen is more toxic__
* __The toxic agent is not acetaminophen itself but toxic metabolites produced by the cytochrome P\-450 system in acinus zone 3 hepatocytes__
* __These cells die\, the zone 2 hepatocytes take over this metabolic function\, in turn__
* __In severe overdoses the zone of injury extends to the periportal hepatocytes\, resulting in fulminant hepatic failure__

# Idiosyncratic

* __Chlorpromazine__
  * __causes cholestasis in individuals who metabolize it slowly__
* __Halothane__
  * __fatal immune\-mediated hepatitis__
* __Sulfonamides__
* __α\-methyldopa__
* __Idiosyncratic drug or toxin reactions involve a variable combination of__
  * __Direct cytotoxicity__
  * __Immune\-mediated hepatocyte or bile duct destruction__

__Depending on the toxic material different zones may be affected__

__If the toxin is a metabolite of a drug then it may accumulate in zone 3 and most severe effect is seen in zone 3__

# ALCOHOLIC AND NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE

# Fatty Liver Disease

* __Alcohol__
  * __Steatosis__
  * __Steatohepatitis__
  * __Cirrhosis__
* __Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease \(NAFLD\)__
  * __Similar hepatic changes with alcohol__
  * __Associated with metabolic syndrome__
    * __insulin resistance\, obesity\, diabetes mellitus\, hypertension\, and dyslipidemia__

# Hepatocellular Steatosis

* __Fat accumulation typically begins in centrilobular hepatocytes__
* __Small \(microvesicular\)\, large \(macrovesicular\)__
* __Later midlobule and then the periportal regions__
* __Macroscopically\, the fatty liver with widespread steatosis__
  * __Large \(weighing 4 to 6 kg or more\)\, soft\, yellow\, and greasy__

![](img%5CInflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver7.png)

__Fatty liver disease\. Macrovesicular steatosis is most prominent around the central vein and extends outward to the portal tracts with increasing severity\. The intracytoplasmic fat is seen as clear vacuoles\. Some fibrosis \(stained blue\) is present in a characteristic perisinusoidal “chicken wire fence” pattern\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Steatohepatitis

__More with alcohol use than in NAFLD__

__Hepatocyte ballooning__

__Mallory\-Denk bodies__

__Neutrophilic reaction__

* __Hepatocyte ballooning__
  * __Single or scattered foci of cells undergo swelling and necrosis__
  * __Start from centrilobular areas__
* __Mallory\-Denk bodies__
  * __tangled intermediate filaments__
  * __eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in degenerating hepatocytes__

__keratins 8 and 18 __

__ballooned hepatocytes __

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Neutrophil infiltration

__Predominantly neutrophilic infiltration may permeate the lobule__

__Accumulate around degenerating hepatocytes\, particularly those containing Mallory\-Denk bodies__

__Lymphocytes and macrophages also may be seen in portal tracts or parenchyma__

# Steatohepatitis with fibrosis

__First in the centrilobular region\, central vein sclerosis__

__Perisinusoidal scar appears in the space of Disse of the centrilobular region__

__Spreads outward\, encircling individual or small clusters of hepatocytes in a chicken wire fence pattern__

__Link to portal tracts__

__Condense to create central\-portal fibrous septa__

__Liver takes on a nodular\, cirrhotic appearance__

__Classic micronodular or Laennec cirrhosis__

# Course of Fatty Liver Disease

* __Early__
  * __the liver is yellow\-tan\, fatty\, and enlarged__
* __Later__
  * __Persistent damage__
  * __Brown\, shrunken\, nonfatty organ composed of cirrhotic nodules that are usually less than 0\.3 cm in diameter\, smaller than is typical for most chronic viral hepatitis __
  * __End\-stage cirrhotic liver may enter into a “burned\-out” phase__
  * __No fatty change and other typical features__

__Steatosis or fatty change imparts a yellow to orange cast to the liver parenchyma__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

__Alcoholic cirrhosis__

__Diffuse nodularity\. Average nodule size is 3 mm\. Greenish because of bile stasis__

![](img%5CInflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver11.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Steatohepatitis leading to cirrhosis\. Small nodules are entrapped in blue\-staining fibrous tissue; fatty accumulation is no longer seen in this “burned\-out” stage__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Alcoholic liver disease

__Steatosis\, alcoholic hepatitis\, and fibrosis may develop independently__

__Not necessarily represent a continuum of changes__

__Hepatocellular carcinoma arises in 10\-20% of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis__

__Alcoholic liver disease__

![](img%5CInflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver13.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Causes of hepatocellular steatosis

* __Shunting of substrates away from catabolism and toward lipid biosynthesis__
  * __Generation of excess reduced nicotinamide\-adenine dinucleotide__
    * __metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase__
* __Impaired assembly and secretion of lipoproteins__
* __Increased peripheral catabolism of fat__

# Causes of alcoholic hepatitis

* __Acetaldehyde__
  * __metabolite of ethanol__
  * __induces lipid peroxidation and acetaldehyde\-protein adduct formation__
  * __disrupt cytoskeleton and membrane function__
* __Alcohol directly affects__
  * __cytoskeleton__
    * __Mallory\-Denk bodies__
  * __mitochondrial function__
  * __membrane fluidity__
* __Reactive oxygen species__
  * __oxidation of ethanol by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system__
  * __neutrophils\, areas of hepatocyte necrosis__

* __Cytokine\-mediated inflammation and cell injury__
  * __TNF__
  * __IL\-1\, IL\-6\, IL\-8__
* __Generation of acetaldehyde and free radicals is maximal in the centrilobular region\, this region is most susceptible to toxic injury\. Pericellular fibrosis and sinusoidal fibrosis develop in this area of the lobule\.__
* __Concurrent viral hepatitis\, hepatitis C\, is a major accelerator of liver disease in alcoholics__

# Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

* __Metabolic syndrome__
  * __Having at least two of the following:__
    * __Obesity\, insulin resistance\, dyslipidemia\, and hypertension__
* __Insulin resistance results in the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes__
  * __Impaired oxidation of fatty acids__
  * __Increased synthesis and uptake of fatty acids__
  * __Decreased hepatic secretion of very\-low\-density lipoprotein cholesterol__

* __Fat\-laden hepatocytes__
  * __highly sensitive to lipid peroxidation products generated by oxidative stress__
  * __damage mitochondrial and plasma membranes\, causing apoptosis__

* __Most common cause of incidental elevation of serum transaminases__
* __Significant contributor to the pathogenesis of “cryptogenic” cirrhosis__
* __Pediatric NAFLD__
  * __Increasing problem as metabolic syndrome and NAFLD approach epidemic proportions__
  * __In children__
    * __Inflammation and scarring tend to be more prominent in the portal tracts and periportal regions__
    * __Mononuclear infiltrates rather than neutrophilic infiltrates predominate__

__Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease__

# Drug/Toxin-Mediated Injury with Steatosis

* __Mitochondrial injury leading to diffuse\, hepatocellular microvesicular steatosis__
* __Associated with severe and potentially fatal acute liver dysfunction__
* __Reye syndrome__
  * __<4 age__
  * __viral illness__
  * __Pernicious vomiting\, irritability or lethargy and hepatomegaly__
  * __Serum bilirubin\, ammonia\, and aminotransferase levels are essentially normal at presentation__
  * __25% progress to coma\, accompanied by elevations in the serum levels of bilirubin\, aminotransferases\, and particularly ammonia__
  * __Death occurs from progressive neurologic deterioration or liver failure__

* __Reye syndrome has been associated with aspirin administration__
* __No definitive evidence that salicylates play a causal role in this disorder__
* __Aspirin is contraindicated in children and teenagers with febrile illnesses__
* __Similar mitochondrial dysfunction caused by__
  * __Tetracycline and valproate__
  * __Toxins in unripe ackee fruit\, popular in Jamaica__

    * __disruption of cristae and loss of dense bodies__
* __Cerebral edema__
  * __Astrocytes are swollen__
  * __mitochondrial changes similar to those seen in the liver__
  * __Inflammation is notably absent__
* __Skeletal muscles\, kidneys\, and heart also may reveal microvesicular fatty change and mitochondrial alterations__

# INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASES

# Hemochromatosis

* __Excessive accumulation of body iron__
* __Deposited in the liver\, pancreas\, and heart__
* __Most common form is an autosomal recessive disease of adult onset__
  * __mutations in the HFE gene__
* __Secondary iron overload__
  * __multiple transfusions\, ineffective erythropoiesis \(as in β\-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes\)\, and increased iron intake__

# Hereditary Hemochromatosis

* __Iron accumulates over the lifetime of the affected person__
* __Excessive intestinal absorption__
* __Total iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm\, over one third of which is found in the liver__
* __Fully developed cases__
  * __cirrhosis \(seen in all patients\)__
  * __diabetes mellitus \(in 75% to 80% of patients\)__
  * __skin pigmentation \(in 75% to 80%\)__

![](img%5CInflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver19.png)

__HFE gene__

__Located on the short arm of chromosome 6__

__Encodes a protein that is similar in structure to MHC class I proteins__

__Expression of the mutated HFE protein on small intestinal enterocytes leads to inappropriately upregulated absorption of iron and its binding to transferrin__

__HFE and the other genes involved in less common forms of hereditary hemochromatosis all regulate the levels of hepcidin\, the iron hormone produced by the liver__

__Hepcidin normally down\-regulates the efflux of iron from the intestines and macrophages into the plasma and inhibits iron absorption__

__When hepcidin levels are reduced there is increased iron absorption__

__Excessive iron directly toxic to tissues__

__Lipid peroxidation by iron\-catalyzed free radical reactions__

__Stimulation of collagen formation__

__Direct interactions of iron with DNA__

# Hemochromatosis

* __Deposition of hemosiderin__
* __Liver\, pancreas\, myocardium\, pituitary\, adrenal\, thyroid and parathyroid glands\, joints\, skin\, testis__
* __Liver__
  * __Golden\-yellow hemosiderin granules in the cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes\, which stain blue with the Prussian blue stain__
  * __Progressive involvement of the rest of the lobule__
  * __Bile duct epithelium__
  * __Kupffer cells__

__Accumulation of iron results in a rusty brown liver __

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

![](img%5CInflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver21.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Iron is a direct hepatotoxin\, and inflammation is characteristically absent__

__Liver typically is slightly larger than normal\, dense\, and chocolate brown__

__Fibrous septa develop slowly__

__Cirrhosis in an intensely pigmented \(very dark brown to black\) liver__

__Dry weight:__

__Normal iron content of unfixed liver tissue <1000 µg/g dry weight__

__Clinically evident iron overload of hereditary hemochromatosis exhibit >10\,000 µg/g dry weight of iron__

__>22\,000 µg/g dry weight are associated with the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis__

# Wilson Disease

__Autosomal recessive__

__Accumulation of toxic levels of copper__

__Liver\, brain\, and eye__

__Loss\-of\-function mutations in the ATP7B gene__

__Chromosome 13\, encodes an ATPase metal ion transporter that localizes to the Golgi region of hepatocytes__

__Normal copper physiology__

__Absorption of ingested copper \(2 to 5 mg/day\)__

__Plasma transport in complex with albumin__

__Hepatocellular uptake\, followed by binding to an α2 \-globulin \(apoceruloplasmin\) to form ceruloplasmin__

__Secretion of ceruloplasmin\-bound copper into plasma\, where it accounts for 90% to 95% of plasma copper__

__Hepatic uptake of desialylated\, senescent ceruloplasmin from the plasma\, followed by lysosomal degradation and secretion of free copper into bile__

* __without ATP7B activity__
  * __copper cannot be passed on to apoceruloplasmin and cannot be excreted into bile__
* __Copper accumulates progressively in hepatocytes__
* __Toxic injury by__
* __promoting the formation of free radicals__
* __binding to sulfhydryl groups of cellular proteins__
* __displacing other metals in hepatic metalloenzymes__

* __By the age of 5 years__
  * __Copper begins to escape from the overloaded\, damaged hepatocytes into the circulation__
  * __Free copper generates oxidants Red cell hemolysis__
  * __Deposited and damage to__
  * __Brain\, cornea\, kidneys\, bones\, joints\, and parathyroid glands__
  * __Urinary excretion of copper increases markedly__
* __Hepatocellular carcinoma is quite uncommon in Wilson disease__
* __Kayser\-Fleischer rings__

![](img%5CInflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver22.jpg)

* __May mimic other liver diseases__
  * __Fatty liver diseases__
  * __Viral hepatitis__
  * __Acute and chronic hepatitis__
  * __Excess copper deposition can often be demonstrated by special stains__
    * __rhodanine stain for copper\, orcein stain for copper\-associated protein__
  * __Hepatic copper content in excess of 250 µg/g dry weight is most helpful for making a diagnosis__
* __Basal ganglia\, putamen__
  * __Atrophy and even cavitation__
  * __Hepatolenticular degeneration__
* __Kayser\-Fleischer rings__
  * __Green to brown deposits of copper in Descemet membrane in the limbus of the cornea__

# α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency

__Autosomal recessive disorder__

__Abnormally low serum levels__

__The major function of AAT is the inhibition of proteases__

__Pulmonary emphysema__

__Hepatic disease results from retention of mutant AAT in the liver__

__AAT synthesized predominantly by hepatocytes__

__Most allelic variants produce normal or mildly reduced levels of serum AAT__

__Homozygotes for the Z allele \( PiZZ genotype\) have circulating AAT levels that are only 10% of normal levels__

__PiMZ heterozygotes have intermediate plasma levels of AAT__

__The PiZ polypeptide contains a single amino acid substitution that results in misfolding of the nascent polypeptide in the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum__

__Mutant protein cannot be secreted by the hepatocyte\, it accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and triggers unfolded protein response\, lead to induction of apoptosis__

__Marked cholestasis with hepatocyte necrosis in newborns__

__Childhood cirrhosis__

__Chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis that becomes apparent only late in life__

__Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 2% to 3% of adults with PiZZ genotype\, usually but not always in the setting of cirrhosis__

__The treatment and cure for the severe hepatic disease are orthotopic liver transplantation__
