# Chronic Inflammation

* __inflammation of prolonged duration \(weeks to years\)__
* __continuing inflammation__
* __tissue injury__
* __healing__
  * __often by fibrosis__

__proceed simultaneously__

* __Infiltration with mononuclear cells__
  * __macrophages\, lymphocytes\, and plasma cells__
* __Tissue destruction__
  * __induced by the products of the inflammatory cells__
* __Repair__
  * __new vessel proliferation \(angiogenesis\) and fibrosis__

# Chronic inflammation may arise:1) From acute inflammation

* __acute response cannot be resolved__
  * __persistence of the injurious agent__
  * __interference with the normal process of healing__

# Chronic inflammation may arise:2) Persistent infections by microbes that are difficult to eradicate

__Mycobacterium tuberculosis__

__Treponema pallidum__

__syphilis__

__certain viruses and fungi__

__tend to establish persistent infections__

__T lymphocyte–mediated immune response__

__delayed\-type hypersensitivity__

# Chronic inflammation may arise:3) Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (hypersensitivity diseases)

* __excessive and inappropriate activation of the immune system__
* __Autoimmune Diseases__
  * __rheumatoid arthritis\, inflammatory bowel disease\, and psoriasis__
* __Allergic Diseases__
  * __bronchial asthma__

# Chronic inflammation may arise:4) Prolonged exposure to potentially toxic agents

__nondegradable exogenous materials__

__inhaled particulate silica__

__endogenous agents__

__cholesterol crystals\, atherosclerosis__

# Are these chronic inflammatory diseases?We do not know the definite answer, yetJury is still out

* __Neurodegenerative disorders__
  * __Alzheimer disease__
* __Atherosclerosis__
* __Metabolic syndrome__
* __Type 2 diabetes__
* __Some forms of cancer__

# Mixed acute and chronic inflammation can be observed in immune mediated diseases

__repeated acute phases__

* __mediators elaborated by macrophages\. __
* __Such inflammatory lesions are designated as follows:__
  * __“acute on chronic” osteomyelitis__
  * __Active chronic gastritis__

__derived from circulating blood monocytes after their emigration from the bloodstream__

__normally diffusely scattered in most connective tissues and organs __

__Liver → Kupffer cells__

__spleen and lymph nodes sinus → histiocytes__

__central nervous system → microglial cells__

# Macrophage Activation

* __induced by microbial products__
  * __endotoxin__
* __T cell–derived signals__
  * __cytokine IFN\-γ__
* __foreign substances__
  * __crystals\, particulate matter__
* __produce lysosomal enzymes\, NO\, and ROS__

__Robbins and Cotran’s Pathological Basis of Diseases__

# Macrophages

* __central to the initiation and propagation of all inflammatory reactions__
* __like neutrophils\, ingest and eliminate microbes and dead tissues__
* __initiate the process of tissue repair__
