# Tuberculosis

- **WHO estimates that tuberculosis causes 6% of all deaths worldwide**
  - **Most common cause of death resulting from a single infectious
    agent**
- **Communicable chronic granulomatous disease**
- **Mycobacterium tuberculosis**
- **Involves the lungs, may affect any organ or tissue**
- **Caseous necrosis**

# Diseases increasing risk of Tbc

**Diabetes mellitus**

**Hodgkin lymphoma**

**Chronic lung disease**

**Silicosis**

**Chronic renal failure**

**Malnutrition**

**Alcoholism**

**Immunosuppression**

**HIV**

# Tuberculosis

**Tbc infection**

**Seeding of a focus with organisms**

**May not cause clinically significant tissue damage**

**If there is clinically significant tissue damage → Tbc disease**

# Mycobacteria

- **Slender rods**
- **Acid-fast**
  - **High content of complex lipids that readily bind the Ziehl-Neelsen
    (carbol fuchsin) stain and subsequently resist decolorization**

# M. tuberculosis hominis

- **Responsible for most cases of Tbc**
- **Reservoir in persons with active pulmonary disease**
- **Transmission usually is direct**
  - **Inhalation of airborne organisms in aerosols generated by
    expectoration**
  - **Exposure to contaminated secretions of infected persons **

# Mycobacterium bovis

**Oropharyngeal and intestinal tuberculosis**

**Contracted by drinking milk contaminated with infection**

# Mycobacterium avium complex

**Much less virulent than M. tuberculosis**

**Rarely cause disease in immunocompetent**

**Cause disease in 10-30% of AIDS**

- **Inhibit normal microbicidal responses**
  - **Prevent the fusion of the lysosomes with the phagocytic vacuole**
  - **Unchecked mycobacterial proliferation**

  - **Transmembrane ion transport protein found in endosomes and
    lysosomes that is believed to contribute to microbial killing**

    effective immune response**

# Primary Tuberculosis

- **Develops in a previously unexposed, unsensitized patient**

  - **Elderly persons, immunosuppressed patients may lose their
    sensitivity to the tubercle bacillus**
  - **Primary tuberculosis more than once**

- **5% of newly infected acquire significant disease**

- **Bovine tuberculosis is rare**

- **Mostly pulmonary Tbc**

- **Bacilli implant in the distal air spaces**

  - **Lower part of the upper lobe**
  - **Upper part of the lower lobe**
  - **Close to the pleura**

- **Sensitization develops**

- **1-1.5 cm area of gray-white inflammatory consolidation**

  - **Ghon focus**

- **Center of this focus undergoes caseous necrosis**

- **Travel in lymph drainage to the regional nodes**

  - **Caseafication develops**

- **Parenchymal lesion + Nodal involvement → Ghon complex**

upper lobe**

**95% of cases, development of cell-mediated immunity controls the
infection**

**Ghon complex undergoes progressive fibrosis**

**Radiologically detectable calcification (Ranke complex)**

**Despite seeding of other organs, no lesions develop**

# Consequences of primary Tbc

- **Induces hypersensitivity and increased resistance**
- **Foci of scarring may harbor viable bacilli for years, perhaps for
  life**
  - **Nidus for reactivation at a later time when host defenses are
    compromised**
- **Uncommonly, lead to progressive primary tuberculosis**
  - **Immunocompromised**
  - **Malnourished children**
  - **Elderly persons**
- **Lack of a tissue hypersensitivity reaction results in the absence of
  the characteristic caseating granulomas**
  - **Nonreactive tuberculosis**

**Irrespective of the presence or absence of caseous necrosis, use of
special stains for acid-fast organisms is indicated when granulomas are
present**

# Secondary TuberculosisReactivation Tuberculosis

  disease than they are in primary tuberculosis**
