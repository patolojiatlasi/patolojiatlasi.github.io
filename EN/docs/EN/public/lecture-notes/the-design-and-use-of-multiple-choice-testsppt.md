# “The Design and Use of Multiple Choice Tests”

# Multiple Choice Exams

**“ Written properly, multiple choice exams correlate strongly with
assessments by descriptive tests ”**

**Brown, Robert, “Multiple Choice Versus Descriptive Tests”, Frontiers
in Education Conference, Reno NC 2001.**

# Use of Multiple Choice Exams

- **Not limited to Factual Knowledge**
  - \_\_ Making inferences\_\_
  - \_\_ Application of models\_\_
  - \_\_ Evaluation\_\_

# Multiple Choice vs. Descriptive Examinations

**Descriptive**

**Questions**

**Setting the exam**

**Grade Consistency**

# Structure of a Multiple Choice Question

**Stem**

**Answers**

# Formulating GoodMultiple Choice Questions

- **Wording the stem so that there is a single correct answer**
- **Finding plausible wrong answers**
- **Sensitivity to ESL students**
  - **Negative voice in the stem**
  - **Conditional “if… would” structures**
  - **Cultural contexts for questions **

# Stems

- *Statements*
  - \_\_ “A river that flows through a desert is called..”\_\_
- *Questions*
  - \_\_ “ Which of the following descriptions best fits\_\_
  - \_\_ the character of Alsatian wines?”\_\_
- *Ne* **g** *ative voice*
  - **“ Which of the following grapes is ** *not* \_\_ used to\_\_
  - \_\_ make Amarone?”\_\_
- *Conditional Voice*
  - **“ If you want a VQA Niagara red wine that**
  - \_\_ was very fruity and required only a short\_\_
  - \_\_ ageing period you would select: ”\_\_

# Answer Options

**Single correct answer options**

**Collective answer options:**

\_\_ “ (a) and (c) are both correct ”\_\_

\_\_ “ all of the above are correct ”\_\_

\_\_ “ none of the above are correct ”\_\_

# Plausible Answer Strategies

**Good questions contain several plausible answer options**

**Grey area between designing “tricky” questions and providing answer
options that test knowledge thoroughly.**

**Inadvertently giving away the answers **

# Giving away the answer…

**A verbal question:**

\_\_ The forbidden fruit that Eve offered Adam was an:\_\_

\_\_ (a) apple (b) pear\_\_

\_\_ (c) banana (d) melon\_\_

\_\_ (e) carrot\_\_

**i.e. a numerical question:**

\_\_ It costs a vendor \$1.00 each time s/he sells a hot dog to a
customer. If the price of the hot dog is \$3.00, what is the
contribution margin percentage?\_\_

\_\_ (a) 17.5% (b) 22.5%\_\_

\_\_ (c) 47.5% (d) 66.7%\_\_

\_\_ (e) 82.0%\_\_

# “Plausible” Answer Strategy

\_\_ It costs a vendor \$1.00 each time s/he sells a hot dog to a
customer. If the price of the hot dog is \$3.00, what is the
contribution margin percentage?\_\_

\_\_ (a) 300% (b) 200%\_\_

\_\_ (c) 67.7% (d) 50%\_\_

\_\_ (e) 33.3%\_\_

# Plausible Answer Strategies

**Use Nonsense Words ** **:** \_\_ \_\_

\_\_ Colio Wines in Ontario produce an interesting product classified as
Vin de Curé in much the same way as Amarone is made in Veneto. The
Italian word describing the drying process used to desiccate the grapes
is:\_\_

\_\_ a) Ripasso b) Appasimento\_\_

\_\_ c) Raisinato d) Pommace\_\_

\_\_ e) Prunello\_\_

- **Use related, but different terms….**
- \_\_ The word that refers to the addition of sugar to a finished wine
  is:\_\_
  - \_\_ (a) Amelioration\_\_
  - \_\_ (b) Chaptalization\_\_
  - \_\_ (c) Edulcoration\_\_
  - \_\_ (d) Elaboration\_\_
  - \_\_ (e) Oxidation\_\_

# Adding Uncertainty..

**The term “fortified wine” means:**

\_\_ a) the bottle had been reinforced\_\_

\_\_ b) the wine has had tannins and acid \_\_

\_\_ added\_\_

\_\_ c) the wine has had sugar added\_\_

\_\_ d) the wine has had SO\_\_ **2** \_\_ added\_\_

\_\_ e) none of the foregoing\_\_

# Adding difficulty..

**Choose the ** *best* \_\_ answer.\_\_ \_\_ \_\_

\_\_ Rootham’s, a well-known local manufacturer of brandied fruit
preserves sells their product through gourmet food shops and at craft
fairs throughout Canada. Their recipes use genuine brandy and all
natural ingredients. They are able to sell these legally because:\_\_

**(a) the alcohol used is produced by fermentation**

**(b) the product is made with ethyl alcohol**

**(c) the alcohol used is purchased from the LCBO**

**(d) the alcohol concentration is less than 1.2%**

**(e) the label says “made with genuine brandy”**

# Making Multiple Choice Questions Interesting…

\_\_ A gracious, but parsimonious hostess wants to receive guests in the
private dining room of your restaurant with a glass of champagne just to
tantalise the taste buds and set the mood for the evening. \_\_

**1.You suggest that if the wine is being poured at the bar, she should
consider serving a Canadian sparkling wine that is very similar to
Champagne in quality but considerably less expensive. Such a wine would
be a: **

**2. The cheapest sparkling wine would be obvious to sophisticated
guests because they would know that in the best sparkling wines…**

**3. If the gracious hostess insists on having “French” Champagne and
you are left to rationalise costs, the most cost effective solution is
to serve Champagne from.. **

**4. Occasionally, a patron asks you to do something that will
distinguish their event from others. One client wants to obtain a large
bottle of Champagne to celebrate a particular event. Which is the
largest bottle of champagne on the list below? **

**5. If someone wanted to serve a “glass of bubbly” during a reception,
which of the following would be the most ** *ina* **pp** *ro* **p**
*riate* \_\_ type of wine to select as the pre-prandial (before dinner)
libation? \_\_

# Evaluating Multiple Choice Questions

**Difficulty Factor = R/N**

**R = \# of times the correct answer is **

\_\_ selected\_\_

**N = \# of people taking the exam**

# Difficulty Factor

- **Values greater than 0.8:**
  - **The question is too easy**
  - **Stem wording gives away the answer**
  - **Not enough plausible incorrect answer options**
- **Values less than 0.2:**
  - **Guessing effect can be a factor**
  - **The question is defective**
  - **Material wasn’t covered**
  - **Stem wording is unclear, confusing**
  - **Answer options need work **

# Evaluating Multiple Choice Questions

- **Discrimination Index = **
  - \_\_ Proportion of capable students that select an answer option –
    proportion of weak students that select the answer option\_\_
- **i.e. D = F** **top quarter** \_\_ – F\_\_ **bottom quarter**

**Good Discrimination**

**Reverse Discrimination**

# Discrimination Index

*For the Correct Answer Option*

\_\_ Values ~ 0.5 give good discrimination\_\_

\_\_ \< 0.2 consider dropping\_\_

\_\_ negative… drop the question\_\_

*For Incorrect Answer Options*

\_\_ Values should be negative.\_\_

# Knowledge or Successful Guessing?

- **Multiple Choice Exam Strategies**
  - **Improve odds by eliminating 1 or more infeasible or unlikely
    answer options**
- **Descriptive Exam Strategies**
  - **Brain dumping**
  - **Part marks**
  - **Consideration for perfect answers to questions that were not
    asked**

# Possibility of a “Random Pass”

**Depends on the number **

**of answer options per question**

**and the number of questions!**

**Number of Questions**

**Percent Pass (≥50%) by Chance**

**from Brown, 2001**

# Adjustment for Guessing

- **Negative Marking…**
  - **Elimination strategy reduces odds of wrong answer penalty**
  - **Subtracting a percentage of the number of wrong answers obtained
    from the final grade**
  - **Give a grade of 4 for a correct answer and a score of -1 for a
    wrong answer on a 4 choice question**

# Negative Marking..

- \_\_ A score of less than zero is possible\_\_
- \_\_ Students hate negative marking\_\_
- \_\_ Negative marking is not practised in descriptive examinations\_\_
- \_\_ A poor substitute for a test that is too short with too few
  answer options\_\_

# Teaching WithMultiple Choice Questions

**Prepare lectures incorporating all material covered in the questions
to be used**

**After each lecture, check coverage by reviewing questions**

**Provide students with multiple choice questions for self-evaluation at
the end of readings**

# Teaching WithMultiple Choice Examinations

\_\_ Use stem questions to teach additional or ancillary terms not
covered in the course:\_\_

\_\_ i.e. …. For post-prandial (after dinner) drinks you want to stock a
supply of fortified wines and brandy. The term “fortified wine”
means….\_\_

# Provide Students the Stem Questions Prior to the Exam!

**Exam questions should cover all the course material being tested**

**Provides more detail than a course outline**

**Students focus their study effort on the topics they understand the
least**

**Increases learning**

**Reduces stress**

Thanks for your interest in my topic!

I look forward to your questions and ideas.
