# Malabsorptive Diarrhea

- **Chronic diarrhea**
- **Defective absorption of**
  - **Fats**
  - **Fat- and water-soluble vitamins**

    forms**
- **Terminal digestion**
  - **hydrolysis of carbohydrates and peptides by disaccharidases and
    peptidases**
  - **in the brush border of the small intestinal mucosa**
- **Transepithelial transport**
  - **nutrients, fluid, and electrolytes are transported across and
    processed within the small intestinal epithelium**
- **Lymphatic transport of absorbed lipids**

# CELIAC DISEASE

# Celiac Disease

![](./img-local/Malabsorption2.jpg)

- **Celiac sprue**

- **Gluten-sensitive enteropathy**

- **Immune-mediated enteropathy**

- **Triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals (tahıl)**

  - **Wheat (buğday), rye (çavdar), barley (arpa)**

- **Occur in genetically predisposed persons**

- **White people of European ancestry**

  - **common disorder, estimated prevalence of 0.5% to 1%**

- **Primary treatment is a gluten-free diet**

![](./img-local/Malabsorption3.png)

- **Intestinal immune reaction to gluten**
- **Gluten is digested by luminal and brush border enzymes into amino
  acids and peptides**
- **33–amino acid gliadin peptide**
  - **resistant to degradation by gastric, pancreatic, and small
    intestinal proteases **

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Gliadin is deamidated by tissue transglutaminase**

**Interact with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 on antigen-presenting cells**

**Presented to CD4+ T cells**

**T cells produce cytokines**

**Tissue damage and characteristic mucosal histopathology**

- **B cell response**
- **Production of antibodies**
  - **Anti-tissue transglutaminase**
  - **Anti-deamidated gliadin**
  - **Anti-endomysial antibodies**
    - **Produced as a result of cross-reactive epitopes**
    - **used for diagnosis**
    - **Contribution to celiac disease pathogenesis is controversial**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Malabsorption6.png)

- **T cells**
- **Accumulation of CD8+ cells**
  - **not specific for gliadin**
- **Cause tissue damage**
- **Deamidated gliadin peptides induce epithelial cells**
- **Epithelial cells produce IL-15**
- **IL-15 triggers activation and proliferation of CD8+ intraepithelial
  lymphocytes**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Intraepithelial lymphocytes activated via IL-15 express NKG2D**

**NKG2D is a ligand for MIC-A receptor (HLA class I–like protein) found
on enterocytes**

**some factors induce some enterocytes to express MIC-A**

**Lymphocytes become cytotoxic and kill enterocytes that express surface
MIC-A**

![](./img-local/Malabsorption7.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are involved in the
  tissue responses to gliadin**
- **Host factors determine whether disease develops**
  - **HLA proteins are important in less than half of cases**
  - **Almost all people with celiac disease carry the class II HLA-DQ2
    or HLA-DQ8 alleles**
- **Associated with other immune diseases**
  - **Type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis, and Sjögren syndrome**

- **Biopsy specimens**
  - **Taken from the second portion of the duodenum or proximal
    jejunum**
  - **These areas are exposed to the highest concentrations of dietary
    gluten**
- **Morphologic alterations present in celiac disease**
  - **Villous atrophy**
  - **Increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)**
  - **Epithelial proliferation with crypt elongation**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Loss of mucosal and brush border surface area leads to
  malabsorption**
- **Increased rates of epithelial turnover limit the ability of
  absorptive enterocytes to fully differentiate**
  - **contribute to defects in terminal digestion and transepithelial
    transport**

- **Endemic pathogens??**
- **Intestinal biopsies on limited number of patients**
  - **similar to those of severe celiac disease, not to those of
    infectious enteritis**
- **Recurrent diarrhea cause a cycle of mucosal injury, malnutrition,
  infection, and inflammation**
