# VALVULAR HEART DISEASES

# Stenosis

- **Failure of a valve to open completely**
- **Obstructing forward flow**
- **Chronic process**
  - *Calcification or valve scarring*

# Insufficiency

- **Failure of a valve to close completely**
- **Regurgitation (backflow) of blood**
- **Caused by:**
  - **Intrinsic disease of the valve cusps**
    - **Endocarditis**
  - **Disruption of the supporting structures**
    - **Aorta, mitral annulus, tendinous cords, papillary muscles,
      ventricular free wall **
- **Can be acute or chronic**
  - **Chordal rupture**
  - **Leaflet scarring and retraction**

# Stenosis and regurgitation

- **Can occur alone or together**

- **Can involve only one valve**

  - **Mitral valve most common**

- **More than one valve**

- **Murmurs**

- **Outcome depends on:**

- \_\_ Valve involved\_\_

- \_\_ Degree of impairment\_\_

- \_\_ Speed of pathology\_\_

- \_\_ Effectiveness of compensatory mechanisms\_\_

- **Sudden destruction of an aortic valve cusp by infection**

  - **Massive regurgitation, abrupt cardiac failure**

- **Rheumatic mitral stenosis**

  - **Progresses over years**
  - **Well tolerated until late in the course**

# Bicuspid aortic valve

**Most common congenital valvular lesion**

**1-2% of all live births**

**Mutations Notch signaling pathway**

**Cusps are of unequal size**

**Larger cusp has a midline raphe resulting from incomplete cuspal
separation **

**Neither stenotic nor incompetent through early life**

**Prone to early and progressive degenerative calcification**

# Acquired stenoses

**Acquired stenoses of the aortic and mitral valves account for
approximately two thirds of all valve disease**

# Degenerative Valve Disease

- **Changes that affect the integrity of valvular extracellular matrix
  (ECM)**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Changes that affect the integrity of valvular extracellular matrix
  (ECM)**

  inhibitors**

# Calcific Aortic Stenosis

# Rheumatic heart disease

- **Valvular stenosis and regurgitation**
  - **Stenosis predominate**
- **Mitral valve alone → 70%**
- **Combined mitral and aortic → 25%**
- **Tricuspid → less frequently, less severely**
- **Pulmonic valve → almost always spared**

**Mitral stenosis → Left atrium progressively dilates → Atrial
fibrillation → Thrombosis**

**Mitral stenosis → Left-sided heart failure → Pulmonary vascular and
parenchymal changes → Right ventricular hypertrophy and failure**

**In pure mitral stenosis, the left ventricle is generally normal**

# ENDOCARDITIS

# Infective Endocarditis
