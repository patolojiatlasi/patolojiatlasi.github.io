# What is Cancer?

- **“A neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which
  exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues and
  persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli
  which evoked the change.”**
  - **British oncologist R.Willis, 1952**

# Cancer is a genetic disease

**Genetic changes allow excessive and unregulated proliferation that
becomes autonomous (independent of physiologic growth stimuli), although
tumors generally remain dependent on the host for their nutrition and
blood supply.**

# The field of Cancer Research is broad

- **Pathology**
- **Morphology**
- **Pharmacology**
- **Genetics**
- **Epidemiology**
- **Biochemistry**
- **System Biology**
- **Evolution**
- **Population dynamics**
- **…**
- **AS WELL AS**
  - **Quackery, fraudulency, charlatan, cheating ….**

# When will there be a cure for cancer?

**Which cancer?**

**Hodgkin lymphoma is highly curable**

**Pancreas Cancer is nearly always fatal**

# Cancer is a genetic disorder

- **DNA mutations**
  - **acquired spontaneously**
  - **induced by environmental insults**
- **Epigenetic changes**
  - **DNA methylation**
  - **Histone modifications**
- **Genetic instability**
- **Genetic changes affect the ability of**
  - **Growth, survival, senescence**

# Genetic alterations are heritable

**Passed to daughter cells via cell division**

**Cells with growth and survival advantages dominate the population**

**One single cell ultimately gives rise to the tumor → all tumors are
clonal**

# Hallmarks of Cancer - Properties of Cancer

- **self-sufficiency in growth signals**
  - **whereby the growth of cancers becomes autonomous and is
    unregulated by physiologic cues**
- **lack of response to growth inhibitory signals that control
  non-neoplastic cellular proliferations such as hyperplasias**
- **evasion of cell death, allowing cancer cells to survive under
  conditions that induce apoptosis in normal cells**
- **limitless replicative potential, thus making cancer cells immortal**
  - **He-La ** **Cell** \_\_ Line\_\_
- **development of angiogenesis to sustain the growth of cancer cells**
- **ability to invade local tissues and spread to distant sites**
- **reprogramming of metabolic pathways—specifically, a switch to
  aerobic glycolysis even when there is abundant oxygen**
- **ability to evade the immune system**

# NOMENCLATURE

# Some Terminology

**Aplasia**

**Hyperplasia**

**Metaplasia**

**Neoplasia**

**Dysplasia**

**Tumor**

**Mass**

**Oncology (oncos: tumor)**

# Neoplasia “new growth”

- **Neoplastic**
  - **Transformed**
- **Continue to replicate**
  - **does not take into account the control of normal regulatory
    influences of growth**
  - **Autonomy**
    - **Not complete some still require endocrine stimulation, treated
      as such**
- **Increase in size**
  - **Depend on the host for nutrition, blood supply**

# Benign Tumors

**Microscopic and gross characteristics are considered to be relatively
innocent**

**remain localized, local surgical removal**

**patient generally survives**

**sometimes they are responsible for serious disease**

# Malignant Tumors

**Cancers**

**From the Latin word for “crab”**

**Adhere to any part that they seize in an obstinate manner, similar to
a crab’s behavior**

# 

**Cancer**

**Carcinoma**

**Malignant Epithelial Tumor**

**Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor**

**Small Blue Round Cell Tumor**

**Leukeima**

**Lymphoma**

# Malignant

**Invade and destroy adjacent structures**

**Spread to distant sites (metastasize) **

**Cause death**

**Not all cancers go into a deadly course**

**Most aggressive are also some of the most curable**

# Tumors have two components

- **Parenchyma**
  - **Transformed or neoplastic cells**
- **Stroma**
  - **Supporting, host-derived, non-neoplastic stroma**
  - **Connective tissue, blood vessels, and host-derived inflammatory
    cells**
- **Parenchyma**
  - **determines its biologic behavior**
  - **tumors named according to parenchmal cells**
- **Stroma**
  - **crucial to the growth of the neoplasm**
  - **blood supply**
  - **support for the growth**
- **A two-way conversation**
  - **Epithelial Mesenchymal Interactions / Transitions**

# Nomenclature of Neoplasms

- **A problem of Taxonomy**
- **Classification of Neoplasms**
- **Subject to change over time**
- **Different classification schemes and proposals for each group of
  tumor**
  - **Schools are different:**
    - **Japanese, European, North American, South American**
  - **Authors from same country also have different opinions**

# WHO Classification of Neoplasms

- **Updated every 5-7 years**
- **Aim is:**
  - **To form a unified terminology**
  - **Define distinct diseases in terms of morphological, clinical,
    genetic features**
  - **Started adding therapeutic subgroups as well**
