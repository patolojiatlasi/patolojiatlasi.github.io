# EVASION OF CELL DEATH

__Resistance to Apoptosis__

![](img%5CHallmarks-of-Cancer-22.png)

# Extrinsic Pathway

__TNF receptor CD95 \(Fas\) binds to ligand CD95L__

__Trimerization of the receptor and cytoplasmic death domains__

__Attract the intracellular adaptor protein FADD__

__Procaspase\-8 activated by cleavage into smaller subunits__

__Caspase\-8 activates downstream caspase\-3__

__Cleaves DNA and other substrates__

__Cell death__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Intrinsic Pathway

__Withdrawal of survival factors\, stress\, and injury__

__Permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane__

__Cytochrome c leaks into the cytosol__

__Binds to APAF\-1__

__Activates caspase\-9__

__Cleave and activate the executioner caspases__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

* __Pro\-apoptotic proteins__
  * __BAX and BAK__
  * __Directly promote mitochondrial permeabilization__
* __Anti\-apoptotic proteins__
  * __BCL2 and BCL\-XL__
  * __inhibit BAX and BAK__
* __BH3\-only proteins__
  * __BAD\, BID\, and PUMA__
  * __Regulate the balance between the pro\- and anti\-apoptotic proteins__

# Follicular B cell Lymphoma

* __t\(14;18\) \(q32;q21\) translocation__
* __14q32__
  * __chromosomal locus for Ig heavy\-chain genes__
  * __Transcriptionally active__
* __18q21__
  * __BCL2__
* __When they come together__
  * __Overexpression of the BCL2 protein__
* __B cells are protected from apoptosis__
* __They are indolent tumors__
  * __Since the change is not actively proliferating cells but preventing from death__

# Autophagy

__Stress may also induce cells to consume their components__

__Cancer cells may accumulate mutations to avoid autophagy__

__Cancer cells use autophagy to survive in unfriendly climates or during therapy__

# LIMITLESS REPLICATIVE POTENTIAL

# Telomer Shortening in normal human cells

![](img%5CHallmarks-of-Cancer-26.png)

__Capacity of 60 to 70 doublings__

__Shortening of telomeres__

__Recognized by the DNA repair machinery as double\-stranded DNA breaks__

__Then enter senescence__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Telomer shortening in neoplasia

![](img%5CHallmarks-of-Cancer-27.png)

__TP53 or RB mutations\, cell is forced to replicate__

__Nonhomologous end\-joining pathway is activated__

__Joining the shortened ends of two chromosomes\.__

__Dicentric chromosomes__

__Pulled apart at anaphase__

__Resulting in new double\-stranded DNA breaks__

__Genomic instability due to repeated bridge–fusion–breakage cycles__

__Apoptosis may occur__

__Rubin’s Pathology 7th Ed__

![](img%5CHallmarks-of-Cancer-29.png)

* __Telomere maintenance is seen in virtually all types of cancers__
* __Upregulation of the enzyme telomerase__
* __Colon tumors__
  * __Early lesions have high genomic instability\, low telomerase__
  * __Malignant cells have complex karyotype\, high telomerase__

# DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINED ANGIOGENESIS

# Tumor Vessels

* __Tumors cannot enlarge beyond 1\-2 mm in diameter unless they are vascularized__
* __Cancer cells and large benign tumors can stimulate neoangiogenesis__
  * __New vessels sprout from previously existing capillaries__
* __Vasculogenesis__
  * __Endothelial cells are recruited from the bone marrow__
* __Tumor vasculature is abnormal__
  * __Vessels are leaky and dilated__
  * __Haphazard pattern of connection__

# Effects of vascularization on tumor

* __Supplies needed nutrients and oxygen__
* __Newly formed endothelial cells stimulate the growth of adjacent tumor cells__
  * __Secrete growth factors insulin\-like growth factors\, PDGF\, and granulocyte\-macrophage colony\-stimulating factor__
* __Required for continued tumor growth__
* __Necessary for metastasis__

# Factors in Angiogenesis

* __Vascular endothelial growth factor \(VEGF\)__
  * __Angiogenesis inducer__
* __Thrombospondin\-1 \(TSP\-1\)__
  * __Angiogenesis inhibitor__
* __Normal p53 induces synthesis of TSP\-1__
* __Production of angiogenic factors and/or loss of angiogenesis inhibitors__
  * __Directly by the tumor cells themselves__
  * __Inflammatory cells \(macrophages\)__
  * __Other stromal cells associated with the tumors__

# Production of Factors in Angiogenesis

* __Proteases__
  * __elaborated by the tumor cells directly or from stromal cells__
  * __regulate the balance between angiogenic and anti\-angiogenic factors__
* __Angiogenic basic FGF stored in the extracellular matrix \(ECM\)__
  * __Released by proteases__
* __Angiogenesis inhibitors—angiostatin\, endostatin\, and vasculostatin—are produced by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen\, collagen\, and transthyretin\, respectively__
* __TSP\-1 is produced by stromal fibroblasts themselves in response to signals from the tumor cells__

# Normoxia

__HIF\-1α activates transcription of VEGF__

__HIF\-1α is continuously produced__

__von Hippel–Lindau protein \(VHL\) binds to HIF\-1α__

__Ubiquitination __

__Destruction of HIF\-1α__

__No VEGF production in normal oxygen levels__

# Hypoxia

__Tumor that has reached a critical size__

__Lack of oxygen prevents HIF\-1α recognition by VHL__

__HIF\-1α is not destroyed__

__HIF\-1α translocates to the nucleus__

__Activates transcription of its target genes\, such as VEGF__

__Angiogenesis occurs__

__Anti\-VEGF antibody used in the treatment__

# von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome

* __VHL acts as a tumor suppressor gene__
* __Germline mutations of the VHL gene__
  * __Hereditary renal cell cancers__
  * __Pheochromocytomas__
  * __Hemangiomas of the central nervous system__
  * __Retinal angiomas__
  * __Renal cysts__
