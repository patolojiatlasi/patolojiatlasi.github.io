# Introduction to Pathology

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Pathology

__Study \(logos\)__

__Disease \(pathos\)__

__Literally translated\, __  _pathology_  __ is the study \(__  _logos_  __\) of disease \(__  _pathos\,_  __ suffering\)__

* __Study of changes that underlie in disease__
  * __Organs__
  * __Tissues__
  * __Cells__
  * __Genes__
  * __Proteins\, enzymes__
* __Changes__
  * __Structural changes__
  * __Biochemical changes__
  * __Functional changes__
* __These changes give rise to signs and symptoms in a patient__

# Pathology uses

* __Morphologic techniques__
  * __Macroscopy__
  * __Long live the classic friend\!: H&E__
* __Molecular techniques__
  * __PCR\, ISH\, GWAS\, Next\-gen Seq__
* __Microbiologic techniques__
  * __Various methods to identify microorganisms__
* __Immunologic techniques__
  * __Immunohistochemistry__
* __And autopsy__
  * __A very informative technique nowadays forgotten__

# Pathology tries to explain whys and wherefores

* __What is the morphologic change in the cells\, tissues\, organs in the disease?__
* __Are these morphologic changes constant\, reproducible in certain disease?__
* __What is the cause of this morphologic change?__
* __What is the subcellular mechanism of this morphologic change?__
  * __Electron microscopy__

* __What proteins are involved in the disease?__
  * __Histochemistry\, Immunohistochemistry__
* __What effect do these proteins make on morphology?__
* __What is the genetic change causing the change in proteins?__

__Is there any microorganism around?__

__Is the changes in morphology caused by microbes constant in certain diseases?__

__What is the main cause of death in a patient or victim?__

__What is the mechanism taken place during the death?__

* __How are signs and symptoms related to diseases?__
* __What is the way to cure a patient?__
* __Does the therapy have a rational base?__
  * __Will the anti tyrosine kinase inhibitor be effective in a colorectal cancer patient?__
  * __Does the cancer have K\-Ras mutation?__

__Which disease causes how much survival?__

__Are the subgroups of diseases differ in terms of survival?__

# Pathology is the bridge

__The bridge between the basic sciences and clinics__

__The scientific foundation for all of medicine__

__Did you hear about “evidence based medicine”?__

__Then we will send you to the clinics__

__Systemic pathology will be the topic of next year__

__You should know the roots to understand general pathology__

# General Pathology

* __Reactions of cells and tissues to abnormal stimuli and inherited defects__
  * __Cellular Responses to Stress and Toxic Insults: Adaptation\, Injury\, and Death__
  * __Acute and Chronic Inflammation__
  * __Tissue Renewal\, Regeneration\, and Repair__
  * __Hemodynamic Disorders\, Thromboembolic Disease\, and Shock__
  * __Genetic Disorders__
  * __Diseases of the Immune System__
  * __Neoplasia__
  * __Infectious Diseases__
  * __Environmental and Nutritional Diseases__
  * __Diseases of Infancy and Childhood__

# Systemic pathology

* __Alterations in specialized organs and tissues that are responsible for disorders that involve these organs__
  * __Blood Vessels\, Heart__
  * __White Blood Cells\, Lymph Nodes\, Spleen\, and Thymus__
  * __Lung\, Head and Neck__
  * __Gastrointestinal\, Liver and Biliary Tract\, Pancreas__
  * __Kidney\, Lower Urinary Tract and Male Genital System__
  * __Female Genital Tract\, Breast__
  * __Endocrine System__
  * __Skin__
  * __Bones\, Joints\, Soft\-Tissue__
  * __Peripheral and Central Nervous System__

# Types of diseases

* __Genetic__
  * __Developmental__
* __Infectious__
* __Tumoral__
  * __Benign__
  * __Malignant__

* __Try to learn all diseases in this subgroups and in the clinic try to answer the questions in these four groups:__
  * __i\.e\. “Tell us the pathologies of ovary”__

# Studies of Pathology

__Etiology__

__Pathogenesis__

__Molecular and Morphologic Changes__

__Functional Derangements and Clinical Manifestations__

# Etiology (Why disease arise?)

__Origin of a disease__

__Underlying causes and modifying factors__

# Etiology or Cause

* __Genetic__
  * __Inherited mutations__
  * __Disease\-associated gene variants__
  * __Polymorphisms __
* __Acquired \(one occurred after\)__
  * __Infectious__
  * __Nutritional__
  * __Chemical__
  * __Physical__

# Causes and Risk Factors

__Alterations in Rb protein function leads to cervical cancer__

__HPV is the cause of alterations in Rb function__

__Smoking is the risk factor for cervical cancer__

# One etiology for one disease?

* __Yes\, Some genetic and infectious diseases__
* __No\, in general\.__
  * __We are in a multi\-factorial world__
  * __Atherosclerosis__
  * __Cancer__

__Genetic background \(susceptibility\) \+ environmental effects__

# Pathogenesis (How disease arise?)

__Steps in the development of disease__

__How etiologic factors trigger cellular and molecular changes__

__How these changes give rise to the specific functional and structural abnormalities__

# Pathogenesis

__How the disease forms in sequence__
