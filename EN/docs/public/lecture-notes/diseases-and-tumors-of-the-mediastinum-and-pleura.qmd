# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Pleural Lesions

__Primary intrapleural bacterial infections__

__Primary neoplasm\, malignant mesothelioma__

__A secondary complication of an underlying pulmonary disease__

# Pleural Effusion and Pleuritis

__Suppurative pleuritis__

__Empyema__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

# Pleural effusions

* __Transudates and serous exudates__
  * __Resorbed without residual effects__
* __Fibrinous\, hemorrhagic\, and suppurative exudates __
  * __Organization\,  adhesions\, fibrous pleural thickening\, massive calcifications__

# Pneumothorax

* __Presence of air or other gas in the pleural sac__
* __Simple or spontaneous pneumothorax__
  * __Young\, healthy adults\, men without any known pulmonary disease__
* __Secondary pneumothorax__
  * __Thoracic or lung disorder\, emphysema\, fractured rib__
  * __Inspired air goes to pleural cavity__
    * __Emphysema\, lung abscess\, tuberculosis\, carcinoma__
    * __Mechanical ventilatory support with high pressure__

# Complications of pneumothorax

* __Tension pneumothorax__
  * __Leak\- valve__
  * __Shifts the mediastinum__
  * __Compromise pulmonary circulation__
  * __May be fatal__
  * __Leak seals but lung is not reexpanded within a few weeks__
    * __Spontaneously or medical or surgical intervention__
    * __Scarring may occur\,  never fully reexpand__
  * __Serous fluid collects → hydropneumothorax__
    * __Vulnerable to infection__
    * __Empyema → pyopneumothorax__

# Hemothorax

__Collection of whole blood__

__Ruptured intrathoracic aortic aneurysm__

__In contrast with bloody pleural effusions\, the blood clots within the pleural cavity__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

# Chylothorax

* __Milky lymphatic fluid containing microglobules of lipid__
* __Always significant__
* __Obstruction of the major lymph ducts__
  * __intrathoracic cancer__

# Malignant Mesothelioma

__Cancer of mesothelial cells__

__Usually arising in the parietal or visceral pleura__

__Less commonly\, in the peritoneum and pericardium__

__Related to occupational exposure to asbestos in the air__

__50% of persons with this cancer have a history of exposure to asbestos__

__Shipyard workers\, miners\, insulators__

__Living in proximity to an asbestos factory\, a relative of an asbestos worker__

__The latent period for developing malignant mesothelioma is long__

__25\-40 years after initial asbestos exposure__

__With combination of cigarette smoking\, asbestos exposure greatly increases the risk of lung carcinoma__

* __Preceded by extensive pleural fibrosis and plaque formation__
* __Begin in a localized area and over time spread widely__
  * __contiguous growth or by diffusely seeding the pleural surfaces__
* __Lung typically is ensheathed by a yellow\-white\, firm\, sometimes gelatinous layer of tumor that obliterates the pleural space__

__Malignant mesothelioma__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

![](./img-local/Diseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Mediastinum-and-Pleura6.png)

__Malignant mesothelioma__

__Thick\, firm\, white pleural tumor__

__Ensheathes lung__

Robbins Basic Pathology

__Distant metastases are rare__

__Directly invade the thoracic wall or the subpleural lung tissue__

# Mesothelioma patterns

* __Normal mesothelial cells are biphasic__
  * __Pleural lining cells__
  * __Underlying fibrous tissue__
* __Mesothelioma patterns__
  * __Epithelial__
    * __Cuboidal cells line tubular and microcystic spaces__
    * __Small papillary buds project__
    * __Most common pattern__
    * __Confused with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma__
  * __Sarcomatous__
    * __Spindled and sometimes fibroblastic\-appearing cells__
    * __Nondistinctive sheets__
  * __Biphasic\, having both sarcomatous and epithelial areas__

__Papillary formations and desmoplastic stromal reaction\. __

# Asbestos

* __Not removed__
* __Not metabolized__
* __Fibers remain in the body for life__
* __Lifetime risk after exposure does not diminish over time__
* __Asbestos fibers preferentially gather near the mesothelial cell layer__
* __Generate reactive oxygen species__
* __DNA damage with potentially oncogenic mutations__
  * __p16/CDKN2A\, 9p21__

# THYMOMA

# Thymoma

__Tumors of thymic epithelial cells__

__Typically also contain benign immature T cells \(thymocytes\)__

__Tumors that are cytologically benign and noninvasive__

__Tumors that are cytologically benign but invasive or metastatic__

__Tumors that are cytologically malignant \(thymic carcinoma\)__

* __>40 years old__
* __No gender difference__
* __Localisation:__
  * __Most arise in the anterior superior mediastinum__
  * __Sometimes they occur in the neck\, thyroid\, pulmonary hilus\, or elsewhere__
  * __Uncommon in the posterior mediastinum__
  * __20\-30% of tumors in the anterosuperior mediastinum\, which is also a common location for certain lymphomas__

# Clinical Presentation of Thymomas

__40% mass effect__

__30\-45% myasthenia gravis__

__Others incidentally during imaging studies or cardiothoracic surgery__

# Diseases Associated with Thymoma

__Myasthenia gravis __

__Hypogammaglobulinemia__

__Pure red cell aplasia__

__Graves disease__

__Pernicious anemia__

__Dermatomyositis\-polymyositis__

__Cushing syndrome__

# Autoimmune Diseases Associated with Thymoma

__Thymocytes within thymomas give rise to long\-lived CD4\+ and CD8\+ T cells__

__Cortical thymomas rich in thymocytes are more likely to be associated with autoimmune disease__

__Abnormalities in the selection or “education” of T cells maturing within the environment of the neoplasm contribute to the development of diverse autoimmune disorders__

# Thymomas

* __Macroscopically__
  * __Lobulated__
  * __Firm__
  * __Gray\-white masses__
  * __15\-20 cm__
  * __Sometimes cystic necrosis and calcification__
  * __Most encapsulated__
  * __20\-25% penetrate the capsule and infiltrate perithymic tissues and structures__

__Gross appearance of a thymoma showing distinct multinodularity\. There is focal cystic change in the larger nodule\. __

![](./img-local/Diseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Mediastinum-and-Pleura10.png)

# Noninvasive thymomas

__Composed of medullary\-type epithelial cells__

__Mixture of medullary and cortical type epithelial cells__

__The medullary type epithelial cells are elongated or spindle\-shaped__

__There is usually a sparse infiltrate of thymocytes\, which often recapitulate the phenotype of medullary thymocytes__

__Benign thymoma \(medullary type\):__

__Neoplastic epithelial cells in a swirling pattern and have bland\, oval to elongated nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli\. Few small\, reactive lymphoid cells are interspersed\.__

![](./img-local/Diseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Mediastinum-and-Pleura11.png)

# Invasive thymoma

__Tumor that is cytologically benign but locally invasive__

__Much more likely to metastasize__

__Epithelial cells are most commonly of the cortical variety\, with abundant cytoplasm and rounded vesicular nuclei\, and are usually mixed with numerous thymocytes__

__Malignant thymoma\, type I\. The neoplastic epithelial cells are polygonal and have round to oval\, bland nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli\. Numerous small\, reactive lymphoid cells are interspersed\.__

![](./img-local/Diseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Mediastinum-and-Pleura12.png)

# Thymic carcinoma

* __5% of thymomas__
* __Macroscopically__
  * __Fleshy__
  * __obviously invasive masses__
  * __accompanied by metastases\, lungs__
* __Microscopically__
* __Most are squamous cell carcinomas__
* __Lymphoepithelioma\-like carcinoma__
  * __50% contain monoclonal EBV genomes__
