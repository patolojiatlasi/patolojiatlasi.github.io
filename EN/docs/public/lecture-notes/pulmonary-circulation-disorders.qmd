# Pulmonary Circulation Disorders

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# PTE, HEMORRHAGE, INFARCTION

# Pulmonary Embolism

* __Blood clots occlude the large pulmonary arteries almost always embolic__
* __>95% of all pulmonary emboli arise from large deep veins of the lower legs__
  * __popliteal vein and larger veins above it__
* __Can be small and clinically silent__
* __Among hospitalized patients autopsy data 1\-30%__
  * __Severe burns\, trauma\, or fractures__

# Venous thrombosis predisposing factors

* __Prolonged bedrest__
  * __With immobilization of the legs__
* __Surgery__
  * __Orthopedic surgery\, of knee and hip__
* __Severe trauma__
  * __Burns\, multiple fractures__
* __Congestive heart failure__
* __In women\, the period around parturition or oral contraception using birth control pills with high estrogen content__
* __Disseminated cancer__
* __Primary disorders of hypercoagulability__
  * __Factor V Leiden__

# Two important consequences of PTE

* __Increase in pulmonary artery pressure__
  * __From blockage of flow__
  * __Vasospasm caused by neurogenic mechanisms__
  * __Release of mediators__
    * __Thromboxane A2\, serotonin__
* __ischemia of the downstream pulmonary parenchyma__

# Pulmonary Thromboembolism

* __Sudden increase in pulmonary artery pressure__
* __Diminished cardiac output__
* __Right\-sided heart failure__
  * __Acute cor pulmonale__
* __Death__

# Hypoxemia develops in PTE

* __Perfusion of lung zones that have become atelectatic__
  * __Alveolar collapse occurs in the ischemic areas__
  * __Reduction in surfactant production__
  * __Pain leads to reduced movement of the chest wall__
  * __Pulmonary blood flow is redirected through areas of the lung that normally are hypoventilated__
* __Decrease in cardiac output__
  * __Widening of the difference in arterial\-venous oxygen saturation__
* __Right\-to\-left shunting of blood__
  * __Patent foramen ovale\, present in 30% of normal persons__

# Ischemic necrosis in PTE

* __Ischemic necrosis \(infarction\) occur in 10% in PTE__
  * __compromise in cardiac function or bronchial circulation__
  * __that area is underventilated as a result of underlying pulmonary disease__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

# PTE

__60\-80% of emboli are clinically silent__

__5% cause acute cor pulmonale\, shock\, or death__

__Pulmonary infarction__

* __Emboli usually resolve after the initial acute event__
  * __Contract__
  * __Endogenous fibrinolytic activity__
  * __Total lysis of the thrombus__
* __Risk of recurrence is high__
  * __30% chance of developing a second__

# Infarction

* __Compromised cardiovascular status__
  * __Congestive heart failure__
* __The more peripheral the embolic occlusion\, the higher the risk of infarction__
* __3/4 lower lobes__
* __>1/2 are multiple__
* __Wedge\-shaped__
  * __Base at the pleural surface and the apex pointing toward the hilus__

__A small\, roughly wedge\-shaped hemorrhagic pulmonary infarct of recent occurrence__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

# Hemorrhagic infarcts

__Lungs have dual circulation__

__Raised\, red\-blue areas in the early stages__

__Adjacent pleural surface covered by a fibrinous exudate__

__Occluded vessel is found near the apex of the infarcted area__

* __Red cells begin to lyse within 48 hours__
* __Infarct pales__
* __Red\-brown__
  * __Hemosiderin__
* __Fibrous replacement begins at the margins__
  * __Gray\-white peripheral zone__
  * __Converts the infarct into a scar__
* __Hallmark of fresh infarcts is coagulative necrosis of the lung parenchyma and hemorrhage__

# Nonthrombotic forms of pulmonary embolism

* __Air\, fat\, and amniotic fluid embolism__
* __Bone marrow embolism__
  * __Massive trauma__
  * __Bone infarction secondary to sickle cell anemia__
* __Foreign body embolism__
  * __Intravenous drug abuse__
* __Magnesium trisilicate \(talc\) → granulomatous response__

# Talc Granulomas

__Talc in interstitium → fibrosis__

__Talc in pulmonary arteries → Pulmonary hypertension__

__Talc crystals can be demonstrated by polarized light__

# PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

# Pulmonary Hypertension

__Mean pulmonary pressures reach one fourth or more of systemic levels__

__Most often secondary to a decrease in the cross\-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed__

__Increased pulmonary vascular blood flow__

# Secondary pulmonary hypertension

* __Chronic obstructive or interstitial lung disease__
  * __Destruction of lung parenchyma__
  * __Consequent reduction in alveolar capillaries__
  * __Increased pulmonary arterial resistance__
  * __Elevated arterial pressure__

* __Recurrent pulmonary emboli__
  * __Reduction in the functional cross\-sectional area__
  * __Increased vascular resistance__

* __Antecedent heart disease__
  * __Mitral stenosis__
  * __Increases left atrial pressure__
  * __Higher pulmonary venous pressures__
  * __Pulmonary arterial hypertension__
* __Congenital left\-to\-right shunts__

# Primary, idiopathic, pulmonary arterial hypertension

__Most cases are sporadic__

__6% are familial with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance__

# Secondary pulmonary hypertension

* __Endothelial cell dysfunction__
  * __Due to the underlying disorder__
  * __Mechanical injury due to increased blood flow in left\-to\-right shunts__
  * __Biochemical injury produced by fibrin in recurrent thromboembolism__
* __Reduced production of vasodilatory agents__
  * __Nitric oxide\, prostacyclin__

# Primary pulmonary hypertension

* __Uncommon familial form__
* __TGF\-β signaling pathway__
  * __Key mediator of endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction__
  * __Germline mutations of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 \(BMPR\-2\)__

* __The BMPR2 gene product__
  * __a cell surface molecule that binds to a variety of TGF\-β pathway ligands__
  * __inhibits proliferation__
  * __When mutated  → abnormal vascular endothelial and pulmonary smooth muscle proliferation__
* __Possible role for the serotonin transporter gene \(5HTT\)__
  * __Pulmonary smooth muscle cells increased proliferation on exposure to serotonin__

# Vascular alterations in all forms of pulmonary hypertension

* __Involve the entire arterial tree__
* __In the main elastic arteries__
  * __Atheromas__
* __In medium\-sized muscular arteries__
  * __Proliferation of myointimal cells and smooth muscle cells__
  * __Cause thickening of the intima and media__

* __In smaller arteries and arterioles__
  * __Thickening\, medial hypertrophy\, and reduplication of the internal and external elastic membranes__
* __The wall thickness may exceed the diameter of the lumen__
  * __Point of near\-obliteration__
