# Degenerative Diseases of CNS

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Neurodegenerative Diseases

- **Cellular degeneration of subsets of neurons**
- **These subsets are related by function, rather than by physical
  location in the brain**
- **Cause is accumulation of abnormal proteins**
  - **also histologic hallmarks of specific disorders**
- **??Why these abnormal proteins tend to accumulate in and
  preferentially affect particular kinds of neurons??**
  - **Subtle differences among subtypes of neurons**

# Clinical manifestations of degenerative diseases

- **Cerebral cortical neurons**
  - **Loss of memory, language, insight, and planning, all components of
    dementia**
- **Basal ganglia**
  - **Movement disorders**
- **Cerebellum**
  - **Ataxia**
- **Motor neurons**
  - **Weakness**

# 

- **Degenerative diseases have primary targets**
- **Other brain regions are often affected later in the course**
- **Huntington disease**
  - **Start with movement disorders**
  - **Later cortical involvement, cognitive changes**

# Dementia

- **Development of memory impairment and other cognitive deficits**
  - **Severe enough to decrease the affected person’s capacity to
    function at the previous level**
  - **Despite a normal level of consciousness**
- **Arises during the course of many neurodegenerative diseases**
- **Accompany numerous other diseases that injure the cerebral cortex**

# ALZHEIMER DISEASE

# Alzheimer Disease

**Most common cause of dementia in the elderly population**

**Insidious onset of impaired higher intellectual function**

**Altered mood and behavior**

**Progresses to disorientation, memory loss, and aphasia**

**Disabled, mute, and immobile**

**Death usually from pneumonia or other infections**

- **Age is an important risk factor**
  - **3% in 65-74 years old**
  - **19% in 75-84 years old**
  - **47% in \>84 years**
- **Most cases are sporadic**
- **5-10% are familial**
  - **early onset**

**Beta amyloid (Aβ) accumulates in the brain over time**

![](./img-local/Degenerative-Diseases-of-CNS3.png)

# APP (amyloid precursor protein)Transmembrane protein

**Cleaved by α-secretase and γ-secretase**

**Liberates peptide that is nonpathogenic**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Degenerative-Diseases-of-CNS4.png)

**Aβ is created APP is sequentially cleaved by the enzymes β-amyloid
converting enzyme (BACE) and γ-secretase**

**Mutations in APP or in components of γ-secretase (presenilin-1 or
presenilin-2) lead to familial AD by increasing the rate at which Aβ is
generated**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Degenerative-Diseases-of-CNS5.png)

**Aβ peptides form pathogenic aggregates and contribute to the
characteristic plaques and tangles of Alzheimer disease**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Alzheimer Disease

- **APP gene**
- **Chromosome 21**
- **Risk of AD is higher with an extra copy of the APP gene**
  - **Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)**
  - **Small interstitial duplications of APP**
- **Apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4)**
- **Each ApoE4 allele that is present increases the risk of AD by
  approximately 4 fold**
- **Lower the age of onset**
- **How ApoE4 influences Aβ accumulation is unknown**
  - **May increase Aβ aggregation or deposition, or decrease Aβ
    clearance**
- **Small aggregates of Aβ pathogenic**
  - **alter neurotransmission**
  - **toxic to neurons and synaptic endings**
- **Large deposits of Aβ are a feature of end-stage AD**
  - **form of plaques**
  - **lead to neuronal death**
  - **elicit a local inflammatory response**
  - **result in further cell injury**
  - **altered region-to-region communication through mechanical effects
    on axons and dendrites**

**Presence of Aβ leads to hyperphosphorylation of the neuronal
microtubule binding protein tau**

**Redistribution of tau from axons into dendrites and cell bodies**

**Aggregates into tangles**

**Contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cell death**

- **Macroscopic examination**
  - **Variable degree of cortical atrophy**
  - **Widening of the cerebral sulci**
    - **most in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes**
  - **Compensatory ventricular enlargement (hydrocephalus ex vacuo)**
- **Microscopic level**
  - **Diagnosed by**
  - **Presence of plaques, extracellular lesion**
  - **Neurofibrillary tangles, intracellular lesion**
- **May also be present to a lesser extent in the brains of elderly
  nondemented persons**
  - **Diagnosis of AD are based on a combination of clinical and
    pathologic features**
- **Plaques**
- **Tangles**
- **Neuronal loss**
- **Glial reaction**
- **Constant progressive involvement of different parts of the brain**
  - **First in the entorhinal cortex**
  - **Then in the hippocampal formation and isocortex**
  - **Finally in the neocortex**

**Plaques contain a central core of amyloid and a surrounding region of
dystrophic neurites**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

    in the disease course**

surrounding region**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Degenerative-Diseases-of-CNS9.png)

- **The amyloid core contains Aβ**
- **Diffuse plaques**
  - **Aβ deposits can also be found that lack the surrounding neuritic
    reaction**
  - **Typically found in the superficial cerebral cortex, the basal
    ganglia, and the cerebellar cortex**
  - **May represent an early stage of plaque development**

**Lewy bodies may be found in those neurons that remain**

**Single or multiple, intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic, round to elongated
inclusions that often have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in many brain regions**

**Appear first in the medulla and then in the pons, before involvement
of the substantia nigra**

and subcortical areas, including the cholinergic cells of the basal
nucleus of Meynert and the amygdala → Dementia**

    spermatogenesis**
    - **Paternal transmission may be associated with earlier onset in
      the next generation**

    ventral in the putamen**
  - **Globus pallidus may be atrophied secondarily, and the lateral and
    third ventricles are dilated**
  - **Atrophy frequently is also seen in the frontal lobe, less often in
    the parietal lobe, and occasionally in the entire cortex**
