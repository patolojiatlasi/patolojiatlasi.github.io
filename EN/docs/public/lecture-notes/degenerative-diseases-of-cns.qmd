# Degenerative Diseases of CNS

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Neurodegenerative Diseases

* __Cellular degeneration of subsets of neurons__
* __These subsets are related by function\, rather than by physical location in the brain__
* __Cause is accumulation of abnormal proteins__
  * __also histologic hallmarks of specific disorders__
* __??Why these abnormal proteins tend to accumulate in and preferentially affect particular kinds of neurons??__
  * __Subtle differences among subtypes of neurons__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Clinical manifestations of degenerative diseases

* __Cerebral cortical neurons__
  * __Loss of memory\, language\, insight\, and planning\, all components of dementia__
* __Basal ganglia__
  * __Movement disorders__
* __Cerebellum__
  * __Ataxia__
* __Motor neurons__
  * __Weakness__

# 

* __Degenerative diseases have primary targets__
* __Other brain regions are often affected later in the course__
* __Huntington disease__
  * __Start with movement disorders__
  * __Later cortical involvement\, cognitive changes__

# Dementia

* __Development of memory impairment and other cognitive deficits__
  * __Severe enough to decrease the affected person's capacity to function at the previous level__
  * __Despite a normal level of consciousness__
* __Arises during the course of many neurodegenerative diseases__
* __Accompany numerous other diseases that injure the cerebral cortex__

# ALZHEIMER DISEASE

# Alzheimer Disease

__Most common cause of dementia in the elderly population__

__Insidious onset of impaired higher intellectual function__

__Altered mood and behavior__

__Progresses to disorientation\, memory loss\, and aphasia__

__Disabled\, mute\, and immobile__

__Death usually from pneumonia or other infections__

* __Age is an important risk factor__
  * __3% in 65\-74 years old__
  * __19% in 75\-84 years old__
  * __47% in >84 years__
* __Most cases are sporadic__
* __5\-10% are familial__
  * __early onset__

__Beta amyloid \(Aβ\) accumulates in the brain over time__

# APP (amyloid precursor protein)Transmembrane protein

__Cleaved by α\-secretase and γ\-secretase__

__Liberates peptide that is nonpathogenic__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

![](./img-local/Degenerative-Diseases-of-CNS4.png)

__Aβ is created APP is sequentially cleaved by the enzymes β\-amyloid converting enzyme \(BACE\) and γ\-secretase__

__Mutations in APP or in components of γ\-secretase \(presenilin\-1 or presenilin\-2\) lead to familial AD by increasing the rate at which Aβ is generated__
