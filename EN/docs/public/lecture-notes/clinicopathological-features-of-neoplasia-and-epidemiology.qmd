# Clinicopathological Features of Neoplasia and Epidemiology

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Clinical problems caused by both benign and malignant tumors

* __Location and pressure on/ infiltration of adjacent structures__
* __Functional activity__
  * __Hormone synthesis__
  * __Paraneoplastic syndromes__
* __Bleeding and infections__
  * __Tumor ulcerates through adjacent surfaces__
* __Rupture or infarction__
* __Cachexia or wasting__

# Effects of Tumor on Host

* __Location__
  * __1 cm pituitary adenoma → hypopituitarism__
  * __0\.5 cm leiomyoma in renal artery → ischemia and hypertension__
  * __A small tumor on biliary tract → cholestasis\, death__

* __Hormone production__
  * __Islet cell benign and malignant tumors → hyperinsulinemia → hypoglycemia__
  * __Adrenocotical neoplasms → hyperaldesteronism__

* __Ulcer__
  * __Tumors of GI tract__
  * __Intussusception__
  * __Intestinal obstruction__
  * __Infarct__

# Cancer Cachexia

__Progressive loss of body fat__

__Progressive loss of lean body mass__

__Profound weakness__

__Anorexia__

__Anemia__

# Cachexia

* __Correlation between__
  * __Size and extent of spread of the cancer__
  * __Severity of the cachexia__

* __In tumors;__
  * __Despite reduced food intake__
    * __Normally recognized as starvation__
  * __Calorie expenditure remains high__
  * __Basal metabolic rate is increased__
* __Cachexia is NOT caused by the nutritional demands of the tumor__
* __Cytokines produced by the tumor and the host\, rather than reduced food intake__

* __TNF__
  * __Produced by macrophages in response to tumor cells__
  * __Tumor cells themselves mediates cachexia__
* __TNF__
  * __Suppresses appetite__
  * __Inhibits the action of lipoprotein lipase__
  * __Inhibiting the release of free fatty acids from lipoproteins__
* __Proteolysis\-inducing factor__
  * __A protein\-mobilizing factor__
  * __Causes breakdown of skeletal muscle proteins by the ubiquitin\-proteosome pathway__
* __No satisfactory treatment for cancer cachexia other than removal of the tumor__

# Paraneoplastic Syndromes

* __Symptom complexes that cannot be explained by local or distant spread of the tumor__
* __The secretion of unexpected hormone__
* __Important to recognize:__
  * __Earliest manifestation of an occult neoplasm__
  * __Significant clinical illness and may even be lethal\.__
  * __May mimic metastatic disease\, changing treatment__

__Hypercalcemia due to bone metastasis is not considered as paraneoplastic__

__If hypercalcemia is due to PTH related protein then it is a paraneoplastic syndrome__

  * __could be therapeutic targets__
* __Passenger mutations:__
  * __no effect on cell phenotype__

# Geographic and Environmental Variables

* __Environmental factors are the predominant cause of the most common sporadic cancers__
* __Geographic differences in death rates from specific forms of cancer__
  * __Breast cancer__
    * __4\-5x higher in the United States and Europe than in Japan__
  * __Stomach carcinoma__
    * __7x higher in Japan than in the United States__
  * __Liver cell carcinoma__
    * __Relatively infrequent in the United States__
    * __Most lethal cancer among African populations__

* __Environmental factors are the predominant cause of the most common sporadic cancers__
* __These geographic differences are environmental rather than genetic in origin__
  * __Nisei \(second\-generation Japanese living in the United States\)__
  * __Have mortality rates for certain forms of cancer that are intermediate between those in natives of Japan and in Americans who have lived in the United States for many generations__
  * __The two rates come closer with each passing generation__

# Environmental carcinogens are everywhere

__In the workplace\, in food\, and in personal practices__

__Sunlight__

__Asbestos__

__Certain occupation__

__Certain features of diet__

__Cigarette smoking__

__Chronic alcohol consumption__

__Age at first intercourse__

# ?questions to think?

__Why do we see cancer in older people?__

__Why do we see cancer in newborns?__

__Why certain cancers have peaks at certain ages?__

# Age

* __Most cancer deaths occur between ages 55 and 75__
* __The rate declines\, along with the population base\, after age 75__
* __The rising incidence with age__
  * __Accumulation of somatic mutations__
  * __The decline in immune competence__

* __Cancer causes slightly more than 10% of all deaths among children younger than 15 years__
* __The major lethal cancers in children__
  * __Leukemias__
  * __CNS tumors__
  * __Lymphomas__
  * __Soft tissue and bone sarcomas__

# Heredity

![](./img-local/Clinicopathological-features-of-Neoplasia-and-Epidemiology40.png)

* __Inheritance of a single mutant gene greatly increases the risk of developing a tumor__
* __Carriers of mutant Rb have a 10\,000\-fold increased risk of developing retinoblastoma__

__Identified variants in a nicotinic acid receptor__

__Associated with the number of cigarettes smoked__

__Indirectly increase lung cancer risk by enhancing the addictiveness of cigarettes__

# Acquired Preneoplastic Lesions

* __Precursor lesions arise in the setting of chronic tissue injury or inflammation__
* __Squamous metaplasia and dysplasia of the bronchial mucosa__
  * __Habitual smokers__

  * __Women with unopposed estrogenic stimulation__
  * __A risk factor for endometrial carcinoma__
* __Leukoplakia of the oral cavity\, vulva\, or penis__
  * __May progress to squamous cell carcinoma__

  * __Associated with a high risk of transformation to colorectal carcinoma__

# What is the risk of malignant change in a benign neoplasm?

* __Are benign tumors precancerous?__
  * __Adenomas of the colon as they enlarge can undergo malignant transformation in 50% of cases__
  * __Malignant change is extremely rare in leiomyomas of the uterus__
