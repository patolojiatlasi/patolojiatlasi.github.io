**pain and airway obstruction**

# Acute laryngitis

**inhalation of irritants**

# Tuberculosis laryngitis

**Consequence of protracted active tuberculosis**

**Infected sputum is coughed up**

# Diphtheritic laryngitis

- **Widespread immunization**
- **C. diphtheriae implants on the mucosa of the upper airways**
- **Elaborates a powerful exotoxin**
- **Necrosis of the mucosal epithelium**
- **Dense fibrinopurulent exudate**
- **Superficial, dirty-gray pseudomembrane of diphtheria**
- **Sloughing and aspiration of the pseudomembrane**
  - **Obstruction of major airways**
- **Absorption of bacterial exotoxins**
  - **Myocarditis, peripheral neuropathy, or other tissue injury**

# Laryngotracheobronchitis

**Parainfluenza virus most common cause**

**respiratory syncytial virus**

**inspiratory stridor and harsh**

**persistent cough**

**laryngeal inflammatory reaction narrow the airway → respiratory
failure**

# Viral infections in the upper respiratory tract

- **predispose the patient to secondary bacterial infection**
  - **staphylococci, streptococci, and H. influenzae**

purulent exudates**

# NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA

# Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

- **Strong epidemiologic links to EBV**
- **High frequency of this form of cancer among the Chinese**
  - **viral oncogenesis on a background of genetic susceptibility?**
- **EBV replicates in the nasopharyngeal epithelium**
- **Infects nearby tonsillar B lymphocytes**
- **Transformation of the epithelial cells**
- **EBV genome is found in virtually all nasopharyngeal carcinomas**

**Demonstration by in situ hybridization of EBER in nasopharyngeal
undifferentiated carcinoma**

**Rosai and Ackerman’s Surgical Pathology**

- **Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma**
- **Nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma**
- **Undifferentiated carcinoma**
  - **most common**
  - **most closely linked with EBV**
  - **large epithelial cells**
  - **indistinct cell borders**
  - **syncytial growth**
  - **prominent eosinophilic nucleoli**

**Nasopharyngeal carcinoma of keratinizing squamous cell type**

**Rosai and Ackerman’s Surgical Pathology**

**Nasopharyngeal carcinoma of differentiated nonkeratinizing type**

**Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Undifferentiated type.**

**Large neoplastic cells are present admixed with a lymphocytic stroma.

Pathology</span>

# Lymphoepithelioma like carcinoma

- **The other name for undifferentiated carcinoma**
- **EBV directly infects B lymphocytes**
- **Marked proliferation of reactive T lymphocytes causes atypical
  lymphocytosis**
- **a striking influx of mature lymphocytes**
- **Lymphocytes are not part of the neoplastic process**
- **Large neoplastic cells in a background of reactive lymphocytes may
  give rise to an appearance similar to that in non-Hodgkin lymphomas**
  - **Immunohistochemical stains may be required**

# Nasopharyngeal carcinomas

- **invade locally**
- **spread to cervical lymph nodes**
- **metastasize to distant sites**
- **radiosensitive**
- **5-year survival rates of 50%**
  - **even for advanced cancers**

# LARYNGEAL TUMORS

# Vocal cord nodules

**Vocal cord polyps**

**smooth, hemispherical protrusions**

**\<0.5 cm in diameter**

**Located on the true vocal cords**

**Fibrous tissue covered by stratified squamous mucosa**

**can be ulcerated from contact trauma with the other vocal cord**

**heavy smokers or singers (singer’s nodes)**

**Rosai and Ackerman’s Surgical Pathology**

# Laryngeal papilloma

**Squamous papilloma of the larynx**

**Benign neoplasm**

**Located on the true vocal cords**

**Rarely more than 1 cm**

**Multiple, slender, finger-like projections**

**Supported by central fibrovascular cores**

**Covered by an orderly, typical, stratified squamous epithelium**

**Laryngeal papillomatosis **

**Rosai and Ackerman’s Surgical Pathology**

![](./img-local/Diseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Upper-Respiratory-Tract10.png)

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

- **Single in adults**
- **Multiple in children**
  - **Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis**
  - **Recurrence after excision**
  - **Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11**
  - **Cancerous transformation is rare**
  - **Spontaneously regress at puberty**
  - **Vertical transmission from an infected mother during delivery**

# Carcinoma of the Larynx

- **2% of all cancers**
- **\>40 years**
- **More common in men (M:F=7:1)**
- **Nearly all cases occur in smokers**
- **Alcohol and asbestos exposure**
- **Human papillomavirus**
  - **15% of tumors**
  - **Better prognosis**
- **95% squamous cell carcinomas**
- **Adenocarcinomas are rare**
  - **Arise from mucous glands**
- **Glottic tumors**
  - **On the vocal cords**
  - **60-75%**
- **Supraglottic**
  - **Above the cords**
  - **25-40%**
- **Subglottic**
  - **Below the cords**
  - **\<5%**
- **Location of the tumor important for prognosis**
- **Glottic tumors**
  - **90% confined to the larynx at diagnosis**
  - **Interference with vocal cord mobility → Symptoms early**
  - **Glottic region has a sparse lymphatic supply**
- **Supraglottic**
  - **Rich in lymphatic spaces**
  - **1/3 metastasize to regional (cervical) lymph nodes**
- **Subglottic**
  - **Remain clinically quiescent**
  - **Manifest as advanced disease**

**Begin as in situ lesions**

**Pearly gray, wrinkled plaques on the mucosal surface**

**Ulcerating and fungating**
