# GALLBLADDER DISEASES

# Congenital Anomalies

__Agenesis__

__Duplication__

__Bilobed gallbladder__

__Aberrant location__

__Phrygian cap of the gallbladder__

__Fundus is folded inward\.__

![](./img-local/Gallbladder-and-Extrahepatic-Biliary-Tract-Diseases3.jpg)

# Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)

* __10\-20% of adults in Western countries in the Northern Hemisphere__
* __20\-40% in Latin American countries__
* __3\-4% in Asian countries__
* __Cholesterol stones__
  * __Containing crystalline cholesterol monohydrate__
  * __80% of stones in the West__
* __Pigment stones__
  * __Made of bilirubin calcium salts__

* __Bile formation__
  * __Only significant pathway for elimination of excess cholesterol from the body__
  * __Either as free cholesterol or as bile salts__
* __Cholesterol__
  * __Water\-soluble by aggregation with bile salts and lecithins__
  * __Concentrations exceed the solubilizing capacity of bile \(supersaturation\)__
  * __Remain dispersed and crystallizes out of solution__

![](./img-local/Gallbladder-and-Extrahepatic-Biliary-Tract-Diseases4.png)

* __Gallstone formation__
  * __Enhanced by hypomobility of the gallbladder \(stasis\)__
  * __Promotes nucleation__
  * __Mucus hypersecretion__
  * __Consequent trapping of the crystals__
  * __Aggregation into stones__
* __Precipitates are primarily insoluble calcium bilirubinate salts__

# Risk Factors for Cholelithiasis

* __80% no identifiable risk factors other than age and gender__
* __Prevalence increases throughout life__
* __F:M = 2:1__
* __50\-75% in certain Native American populations__
  * __Related to biliary cholesterol hypersecretion__
* __Positive family history increases risk__
  * __Errors of metabolism\, impaired bile salt synthesis and secretion__
* __Estrogenic influences__
  * __Oral contraceptives and pregnancy\, increase hepatic cholesterol uptake and synthesis__
* __Obesity\, rapid weight loss\, hypocholesterolemic agent clofibrate__
  * __Increased biliary cholesterol secretion__
* __Gallbladder motility is reduced__
  * __Pregnancy\, rapid weight loss\, spinal cord injury__
  * __Without obvious cause__

# Cholesterol stones

__Most common in gallbladder__

__50\-100% cholesterol__

__Pale__

__Increasing proportions of calcium carbonate\, phosphates\, and bilirubin impart gray\-white to black discoloration__

__Ovoid and firm__

__Can occur singly__

__Several\, with faceted surfaces resulting from their apposition__

__Most radiolucent\, 20% sufficient calcium carbonate to be radiopaque__

# Pigment stones

* __Anywhere in the biliary tree__
* __Lesser amounts of other calcium salts\, mucin glycoproteins\, and cholesterol__
* __Hemolytic anemias and infections of the biliary tract__
* __Black stones__
  * __Sterile gallbladder bile__
  * __Small in size\, fragile to the touch\, and numerous__
  * __50% to 75% of black stones are radiopaque__
    * __calcium carbonates and phosphates__
* __Brown stones__
  * __Infected intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts__
  * __Single or few in number__
  * __Soft\, greasy\, soaplike consistency__
    * __retained fatty acid salts released by the action of bacterial phospholipases on biliary lecithins__
  * __Radiolucent__
    * __calcium soaps__

# Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)

* __70\-80% asymptomatic throughout life__
* __pain\, often excruciating__
  * __right upper quadrant or epigastric region__
  * __constant or\, less commonly\, spasmodic__
  * __“biliary” pain is caused by gallbladder or biliary tree obstruction\, or by inflammation of the gallbladder itself__
* __empyema\, perforation\, fistulas\, inflammation of the biliary tree\, and obstructive cholestasis or pancreatitis__
* __The larger the calculi\, the less likely they are to enter the cystic or common ducts to produce obstruction__
  * __small stones\, or “gravel\,” are more dangerous__
  * __A large stone may erode directly into an adjacent loop of small bowel\, generating intestinal obstruction \( gallstone ileus \)__

* __Choledocholithiasis and Cholangitis frequently occur together__
* __Choledocholithiasis__
  * __presence of stones within the biliary tree__
  * __Western nations\, almost all stones are derived from the gallbladder__
  * __Asia\, much higher incidence of primary ductal and intrahepatic\, pigmented\, stone__

  * __surgery involving the biliary tree__
  * __Tumors__
  * __indwelling stents or catheters__
  * __acute pancreatitis__
  * __benign strictures__
* __May lead to cholestasis and more importantly sepsis__

* __Suppurative cholangitis__
  * __purulent bile fills and distends bile ducts__
  * __risk of liver abscess formation__

# Secondary Biliary Cirrhosis

* __Prolonged obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree may cause damage to the liver__
  * __Extrahepatic cholelithiasis__
    * __most common cause__
  * __Biliary atresia__
  * __Malignancies of the biliary tree and head of the pancreas__
  * __Strictures resulting from previous surgical procedures__
* __Initially → cholestasis__
  * __entirely reversible with correction of the obstruction__
* __Secondary inflammation → initiates periportal fibrogenesis__
  * __leads to scarring and nodule formation__
  * __generating secondary biliary cirrhosis__

# Biliary Atresia

__Major cause of neonatal cholestasis__

__One third of the cases of cholestasis in infants__

__1 in 10\,000 live births__

__Complete obstruction of bile flow__

__destruction or absence of all or part of the extrahepatic bile ducts__

* __In Asia\, where pyogenic and parasitic diseases of the biliary tree are more common\, gallstones are less important__
* __Gallbladders containing stones or infectious agents develop cancer as a result of recurrent trauma and chronic inflammation__
* __The role of carcinogenic derivatives of bile acids is unclear__

* __Infiltrating growth patterns__

  * __poorly defined area of diffuse thickening__
  * __induration of the gallbladder wall__
  * __may cover several square centimeters or involve the entire gallbladder__
  * __scirrhous and very firm__
* __Exophytic growth pattern__
  * __grows into the lumen as an irregular\, cauliflower\-like mass but at the same time also invades the underlying wall__

* __Adenocarcinomas__
  * __papillary or poorly differentiated__
* __5% are squamous cell carcinomas or demonstrate adenosquamous differentiation__
* __Rare neuroendocrine tumors__
* __By the time gallbladder cancers are discovered\, most have invaded the liver or have spread to the bile ducts or to the portal hepatic lymph nodes__
