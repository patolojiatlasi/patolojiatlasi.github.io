# Santral Sinir Sisteminde Hasar

# Dr. Serdar BALCI

# Santral Sinir Sistemi

* __Anatomi önemli__
  * __Belirti\, bulgu ve klinik özellikler__
* __Histoloji ve reaksiyon paternleri farklı__
* __Kendine özgü tümör ve hastalıkları var__

# SANTRAL SINIR SISTEMI HASAR PATERNLERI

# Nöron hasarı

* __Geri dönüşsüz hipoksik\-iskemik atağın ilk 12 saati:__
  * __Akut sinir hasarı__
    * __Hücredeki değişiklikler \(perikaryon\)__
    * __Aksonlardaki değişiklikler__
    * __Akson hasarına ikincil perikaryondaki değişiklikler__
  * __Kan\-beyin bariyerinin yıkılması__
    * __Serebral ödem__

__Hücrede büzüşme\, piknozis\, nükleol kaybı\, Nissl cisimciği kaybı\, sitoplazmada belirgin eozinofili \(kırmızı nöron\)__

__Nükleus da büzüşen hücre gibi köşeli şekil alır__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Injured axons undergo swelling and show disruption of axonal transport__

__Swellings \(spheroids\) can be recognized on H&E stains and can be highlighted by silver staining or immunohistochemistry\.__

![](./img-local/Santral-Sinir-Sisteminde-Hasar2.png)

__Axonal spheroids are visible as bulbous swellings at points of disruption\, or altered axonal transport\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Axonal injury__

__\-leads to cell body enlargement and rounding__

__\-peripheral displacement of the nucleus__

__\-enlargement of the nucleolus__

__\-peripheral dispersion of Nissl substance \(central chromatolysis\)__

__C: With axonal injury there can be swelling of the cell body and peripheral dispersal of the Nissl substance\, termed chromatolysis\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Other diseases also cause changes in neurons

* __Specific intracellular inclusions__
  * __Neurodegenerative diseases__
    * __Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease__
    * __Tangles in Alzheimer disease__
  * __Pathogenic viruses__
* __Neuronal processes__
  * __thickened and tortuous In some neurodegenerative diseases__
  * __dystrophic neurites__
* __Age__
  * __cytoplasm and lysosomes__
  * __accumulate complex lipids \(lipofuscin\)__

# Astrocytes in Injury and Repair

* __Principal cells responsible for repair and scar formation in the brain__
* __Gliosis__
* __Astrocytes undergo both hypertrophy and hyperplasia__
* __Nucleus enlarges and becomes vesicular__
* __Nucleolus becomes prominent__
* __Gemistocytic astrocyte__
  * __Previously scant cytoplasm expands and takes on a bright pink hue\, and the cell extends multiple stout\, ramifying processes__

__Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease__

# Fibroblasts

__Participate in healing after brain injury to a limited extent__

__Except in penetrating brain trauma or around abscesses__

# Fibrillary astrocytes

__Long\-standing gliosis__

__Cytoplasm of reactive astrocytes shrinks in size__

__Cellular processes become more tightly interwoven__

# Rosenthal fibers

__Thick\, elongated\, brightly eosinophilic protein aggregates found in astrocytic processes in chronic gliosis and in some low\-grade gliomas__

# Oligodendrocytes

* __Produce myelin__
* __Limited spectrum of specific morphologic changes in response to various injuries__
* __Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy__
  * __viral inclusions__
  * __smudgy\, homogeneous\-appearing enlarged nucleus__

# Microglial cells

__Bone\-marrow–derived cells__

__Function as the resident phagocytes of the CNS__

__Activated by tissue injury\, infection\, or trauma__

__Proliferate and become more prominent histologically__

* __Take on the appearance of activated macrophages__
  * __In areas of demyelination\, organizing infarct\, or hemorrhage__
* __Rod cells__
  * __Neurosyphilis or other infections\, they develop elongated nuclei__
* __Microglial nodules__
  * __Aggregates of elongated microglial cells at sites of tissue injury__
* __Neuronophagia__
  * __Collections congregating around and phagocytosing injured neurons__

# Ependymal cells

* __Cytomegalovirus__
  * __can produce extensive ependymal injury__
  * __typical viral inclusions__
