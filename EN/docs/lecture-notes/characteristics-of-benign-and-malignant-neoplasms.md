# DIFFERENTIATION

# Differentiation

- **The differentiation of parenchymal tumor cells**
  - **How much they resemble their normal counterparts**
  - **Morphologically and functionally**
- **Benign neoplasms**
  - **Well-differentiated cells**
  - **Closely resemble their normal counterparts**
    - **Morphologically and Functionally**
- **Lipoma: mature fat cells filled with cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles**
- **Chondroma: mature cartilage cells that synthesize their usual
  cartilaginous matrix**

# Malignant tumor features:increase as tumor approaches anaplasia

- **Marked pleomorphism**

  - **variation in size and shape**

- **Nuclei are extremely hyperchromatic (dark-staining)**

- **Nuclei are large**

- **Increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio that may approach 1:1 (normal
  1:4-1:6)**

- **Giant cells with one enormous nucleus or several nuclei**

- **Nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape**

- **Chromatin is coarse and clumped**

- **Nucleoli may be of astounding size**

- **Mitoses often are numerous and distinctly atypical**

  - **Anarchic multiple spindles, tripolar or quadripolar mitotic
    figures**

- **Fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one
  another**

  - **lose normal polarity**

- **Grow in sheets, with total loss of communal structures**

  - **no gland or stratified squamous architecture**

# Well differentiated tumorsretain normal function and morphology

**Cancers of endocrine organs secrete hormones**

**Squamous cell carcinoma produce keratin**

**Hepatocellular carcinoma secrete bile**

# Some cancers function unexpectedly

- **Secrete fetal proteins**
- **Secrete ectopic hormones**
  - **ACTH, parathyroid-like hormone secreted in lung carcinomas**

# Stromal Changes

- **Capillaries increase in number**
  - **Angiogenesis**
- **Dense abundant fibrous stroma is seen**
  - **Desmoplasia**
  - **Schirrous tumors**

# Dysplasia

- **Disordered**
- **But not neoplastic proliferation**
- **In epithelium**
  - **Pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, increased mitosis … start**
- **When these changes reach the full thickness of epithelium: carcinoma
  in situ**

# RATE OF GROWTH

# How long does it take to produce a clinically overt tumor mass?

- **Original transformed cell**
- **30 population doublings**
- **10** **9** \_\_ cells (1 gm)\_\_
  - **smallest clinically detectable mass**
- **10 additional doubling cycles**
- **10** **12** \_\_ cells (∼1 kg)\_\_
  - **maximal size compatible with life.**

**Until we detect it, tumor completed most of its lifespan**

# Rate of Growth

- **Most benign tumors grow slowly**

  - **months to years**

- **Mitoses are usually rare and have normal configuration.**

- **Most cancers grow much faster, eventually spreading locally and to
  distant sites (metastasizing) and causing death**

- **Some benign tumors grow more rapidly than some cancers**

- **Leiomyoma growth rate depend on circulating estrogen levels**

  - **Increase rapidly in size during pregnancy, then stop growing,
    become largely fibrocalcific, after menopause**

- **Blood supply or pressure affect growth of benign tumors**

  - **Adenomas of the pituitary gland locked into the sella turcica may
    shrink suddenly. A wave of necrosis as progressive enlargement
    compresses their blood supply**

- **In malignant tumors growth rate correlates inversely with
  differentiation**

  - **Poorly differentiated tumors grow more rapidly**

- **Wide variation in the rate of growth**

  - **Grow slowly for years, enter a phase of rapid growth**
  - **Emergence of an aggressive subclone**

- **Some grow relatively slowly and steadily**

  - **More G1 cells than S or M phase cells**

- **Growth may come almost to a standstill**

  - **almost all G1**

- **Some primary tumors (choriocarcinomas) become totally necrotic,
  leaving only secondary metastatic implants**

![](img%5CCharacteristics-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Neoplasms24.png)

**Robbins and Cotran’s Pathological Basis of Diseases**

# Rate of Growth depends on

**the doubling time of tumor cells**

**the fraction of tumor cells that are in the replicative pool**

**the rate at which cells are shed or die**

# Rate of Growth is determined by

- **Counting mitosis under microscope**
- **Detecting tumor cells preparing to divide**
  - **Ki-67 labelling index**
  - **PCNA stains**

# Rate of Growth and Necrosis

**Rapidly growing malignant tumors contain central areas of ischemic
necrosis**

**Tumor blood supply fails to keep pace with the oxygen demand**

**In benign tumors necrosis may occur, degenerative type necrosis**

**In malignant tumor necrosis is abrupt, tumor necrosis**

# LOCAL INVASION

# Local invasion is not seen in benign tumors

- **Benign neoplasm remains localized at its site of origin**
- **Does not have the capacity to infiltrate, invade, or metastasize to
  distant sites**
- **Separated from normal tissue with well defined border**
- **Adenomas slowly expand**
- **Develop an enclosing fibrous capsule**
  - **Separates them from the host tissue**

# Tumor Capsule

- **Derived from**
  - **the stroma of the host tissue**
    - **via pressure atrophy**
  - **the stroma of the tumor**
- **Not all benign neoplasms are encapsulated**
  - **Leiomyoma**
    - **demarcated from the surrounding smooth muscle by a zone of
      compressed and attenuated normal myometrium, no well-developed
      capsule. **
- **Few benign tumors are neither encapsulated nor discretely defined**
  - **some benign vascular neoplasms of the dermis**
- **Lack of a capsule does not mean that a tumor is malignant**

**MUIR’S TEXTBOOK OF PATHOLOGY**

# Local Invasion in Malignant Tumors

- **Malignant tumor growth pattern:**
  - **Progressive infiltration**
  - **Invasion**
  - **Destruction**
  - **Penetration of the surrounding tissue**
  - **Do not develop well-defined capsules**
    - **Slowly growing malignant tumors have stroma around them**
    - **There are tiny penetrating foci into adjacent structures**

**Malignant tumors should be removed with a wide margin of surrounding
normal tissue because of this growth pattern**

**Surgical pathologists examine the margins of resected tumors to ensure
that they are devoid of cancer cells (clean margins)**

**Like metastases, local invasiveness is the most reliable feature that
distinguishes malignant from benign tumors**

# METASTASIS

# Metastasis

**Secondary implants of a tumor**

**Discontinuous with the primary tumor**

**Located in remote tissues**

![](img%5CCharacteristics-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Neoplasms34.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Property of metastasis identifies a neoplasm as malignant**
- **Not all cancers have equivalent ability to metastasize**
  - **Basal cell carcinomas of the skin and most primary tumors of the
    central nervous system, which are highly invasive locally but rarely
    metastasize**
  - **Osteogenic (bone) sarcomas, usually have metastasized to the lungs
    at the time of initial discovery**

**30% of patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors present with
clinically evident metastases**

**20% have occult (hidden) metastases at the time of diagnosis**

**The more anaplastic and the larger the primary neoplasm, the more
likely is metastatic spread**

# Invasion and Spread

- **Malignant tumors invade normal structures and spread**
- **Lymphatic**
- **Capillary, Vein**
- **Spaces**
  - **Peritoneum, Pleura**
  - **Cerebrospinal Fluid**
- **Perineural space (cause local invasion)**

# Spread on body cavities

- **Ovarian tumors**
  - **Spread on peritoneum**
  - **Reimplant on other structures**
    - **This feature is different than local invasion**
- **Tumors of CNS (Medulloclastoma, Ependymoma)**
  - **Spread via CSF**
  - **Implant on meningeal surfaces or spinal cord**

# Lymphatic spread

- **Epithelial tumors**
- **Metastasis develop in lymph nodes**
  - **Drainage sites**
  - **Local lymph nodes**
- **Not all enlarged lymph nodes are metastatic**
  - **hyperplasia of the follicles (lymphadenitis)**
  - **Proliferation of macrophages in the subcapsular sinuses (sinus
    histiocytosis)**

![](img%5CCharacteristics-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Neoplasms35.png)

**Pathology - The Big Picture**

- **Lung carcinoma**
  - **Regional bronchial lymph nodes and then to the tracheobronchial
    and hilar nodes**
- **Breast carcinoma**
  - **Upper outer quadrant→ axillary lymph nodes**
  - **Lower inner quadrant → chest wall, internal mammarian**
- **Both of them then go to infraclavicular and supraclavicular lymph
  nodes**

# Skip Metastasis

**Do not follow usual route**

**Miss one lymph node and develop metastasis in the next one**

# Sentinel lymph node

**The first lymph node the tumor goes to**

**May be detected with certain dyes and radioactive methods**

# Hematogenous spread

- **Mesenchymal and Epithelial tumors**
- **Mostly veins**
- **Follow the venous route**
  - **Abdomen → Liver**
  - **All veins → Lung**
  - **Throid, prostate → paravertebral plexus → vertebra**

![](img%5CCharacteristics-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Neoplasms36.png)

**Rubin’s Pathology 7th Ed**

- **Some tumors grow in veins:**
  - **Renal Cell Carcinoma**
    - **Via inferior vena cava grow into heart**
  - **Hepatocellular Carcinoma**

# Not all metastasis can be explained anatomically

**Prostate carcinoma goes to bone**

**Bronchogenic carcinoma goes to adrenals, brain**

**Neuroblastoma goes to liver, bone**

**Skeletal muscle have abundant vascular structures but not a place for
metastasis**

**Homing of tumor cells**

**What we talk in this lecture are generic statements.**

**Some “benign” tumors may cause death, so they are clinically not
benign at all.**

**Some “very malignant” tumors respond to therapy more quickly.**

**Some well-differentiated tumors do not respond to therapy.**
