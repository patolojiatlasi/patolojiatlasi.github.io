# TUMORS OF SALIVARY GLANDS

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Upper-GI-Tract3.png)

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

**65% to 80% arise within the parotid**

**10% in the submandibular gland**

**remainder in the minor salivary glands, including the sublingual
glands**

**15% to 30% of tumors in the parotid glands are malignant**

**40% of submandibular, 50% of minor salivary gland, and 70% to 90% of
sublingual tumors are cancerous**

*Likelihood that a salivary gland tumor is malignant is inversely
proportional, roughly, to the size of the gland*

# ODONTOGENIC CYSTS AND TUMORS

# Odontogenic Cysts and Tumors

**Jaws are a common site of epithelium-lined cysts derived from
odontogenic remnants**

**Odontogenic keratocyst is locally aggressive, with a high recurrence
rate**

**Periapical cyst is a reactive, inflammatory lesion associated with
caries or dental trauma**

**The most common odontogenic tumors are ameloblastoma and odontoma**
