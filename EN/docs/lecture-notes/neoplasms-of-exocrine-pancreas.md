# Pancreatic Carcinoma

- **Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas**
- **Fourth leading cause of cancer death**
- **5-year survival rate is less than 5%**
- **80% of cases 60-80 years of age**
- **Smoking, doubles the risk**
- **Chronic pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus are also both associated
  with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer**
  - **chronic pancreatitis; cause of pancreatic cancer? effect of it?**
  - **diabetes can occur as a consequence?, new-onset diabetes in an
    elderly patient may be the first sign of this malignancy?**
- **Familial clustering of pancreatic cancer**
- **Germline mutations of the familial breast/ovarian cancer gene
  BRCA2**
  - **10% of cases arising in persons of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage**

**Precursor lesions**

**Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms**

**Mucinous cystic neoplasms**

**Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs)**

**Accumulation of multiple mutations is more important than their
occurrence in a specific order**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Ductal adenocarcinoma

- **Highly invasive**
  - **even “early” invasive pancreatic cancers invade peripancreatic
    tissues extensively**
- \_\_ Desmoplastic response\_\_
  - **Intense non-neoplastic host reaction composed of fibroblasts,
    lymphocytes, and extracellular matrix**
- **Obstruct the distal common bile duct**
  - **50% of such cases, there is marked distention of the biliary
    tree**
  - **jaundice**
- **Carcinomas of the body and tail of the pancreas do not impinge on
  the biliary tract and hence remain silent**
  - **quite large and widely disseminated by the time they are
    discovered**
- **Extend through the retroperitoneal space**
- **Entrap adjacent nerves**
  - **pain**
- **Invade the spleen, adrenals, vertebral column, transverse colon, and
  stomach**
- **Peripancreatic, gastric, mesenteric, omental, and portahepatic lymph
  nodes**
- **Liver often is enlarged as a consequence of metastatic deposits**
- **Distant metastases to the lungs and bones**
