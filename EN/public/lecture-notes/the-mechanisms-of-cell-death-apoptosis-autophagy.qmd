# Apoptosis and Necrosis may occur together

# Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte–Mediated Apoptosis

* __CTLs recognize foreign antigens presented on the surface of infected host cells and tumor cells__
  * __Granzymes enter the target cells__
  * __Granzymes activate cellular caspases__
  * __Kills target cells by directly inducing the effector phase of apoptosis\, without engaging mitochondria or death receptors__
