# Tuberculosis

# Primary Tuberculosis

# Consequences of primary Tbc

* __Induces hypersensitivity and increased resistance__
* __Foci of scarring may harbor viable bacilli for years\, perhaps for life__
  * __Nidus for reactivation at a later time when host defenses are compromised__
* __Uncommonly\, lead to progressive primary tuberculosis__
  * __Immunocompromised__
  * __Malnourished children__
  * __Elderly persons__
* __Lack of a tissue hypersensitivity reaction results in the absence of the characteristic caseating granulomas__
  * __Nonreactive tuberculosis__

__Irrespective of the presence or absence of caseous necrosis\, use of special stains for acid\-fast organisms is indicated when granulomas are present__
