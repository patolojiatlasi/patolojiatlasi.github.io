# Pathology of the Small Intestines, Colon and Appendix

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Intestines

* __Intestines face the “exterior” surface where many “foreign” elements to the body are located__
  * __Food\, bacteria__
    * __Bacteria \(beacteriom\) outnumber the human cells \(genome\) by 10x__
  * __Infections\, inflamations__
    * __Incluiding inflamation against foreign elements\, allergy__

* __Tubes__
  * __Absence of tube__
  * __Perforation__
  * __Duplication__
  * __Kink formation__
* __Living organs depending on circulation__
* __Subject to systemic disease__
* __Tumors__

# INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION

# Intestinal Obstruction

* __May occur at any level__
* __Small intestine is most often involved__
  * __Relatively narrow lumen__
* __Hernias\, intestinal adhesions\, intussusception\, and volvulus account for 80% of mechanical obstructions__
* __Tumors and infarction account others__
* __Abdominal pain\, distention\, vomiting\, and constipation__
* __Surgery is necessary for most cases__
