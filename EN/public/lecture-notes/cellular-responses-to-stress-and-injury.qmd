# Pathologic hypertrophy

__Atlas of Autopsy Pathology\, 2__  __nd__  __ ed\. Figure 15\-33   Left ventricular hypertrophy\. The short\-axis plane of section shows the cavities and entire circumference of the ventricular walls to good advantage\. In this patient with hypertension\, the left ventricular cavity is small because of concentric hypertrophy of the walls and papillary muscles\.__

![](./img-local/Cellular-Responses-to-Stress-and-Injury9.jpg)

__Atlas of Autopsy Pathology\, 2__  __nd__  __ ed\. __  __Figure 15\-34__  __   Right ventricular hypertrophy\. These short\-axis cuts of the heart from an adult with a congenital ventricular septal defect show the right ventricular hypertrophy and marked cavity dilation that are associated with long\-standing pulmonary hypertension\. In the normal heart\, the right ventricular apex does not quite reach the apex of the heart\, so in this specimen the apical cut \(top\) is particularly revealing\. The left ventricle is relatively normal\. __  _RV\,_  __ Right ventricle; __  _LV\,_  __ left ventricle\. __

__Atlas of Autopsy Pathology\, 2__  __nd__  __ ed\. __  __Figure 15\-35__  __   Concentric and eccentric hypertrophy\. The difference between concentric hypertrophy and eccentric hypertrophy is illustrated in these two short\-axis cuts from two different hearts of approximately the same weight \(__  _left\,_  __ 575 g; __  _right\,_  __ 600 g\)\. In the specimen on the left\, the left ventricular cavity __  _\(LV\)_  __ is dilated and the walls appear nearly normal in thickness\. In contrast\, the heart on the right has very thick left ventricular walls that diminish the cavity\. Both specimens showed histopathologic features of hypertrophy\. __

__Atlas of Autopsy Pathology\, 2__  __nd__  __ ed\. __  __Figure 15\-37__  __   Right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation\. Normally\, the right ventricular apex does not quite reach the apex of the heart\. This apical cut of a heart from a patient with chronic liver disease shows the right ventricular cavity\, consistent with pulmonary hypertension\. __

# Mechanisms of Cardiac Hypertrophy

* __mechanical triggers__
  * __Stretch__
  * __increase in the amount of blood volume__
  * __Push blood to a resistant channel__
* __trophic triggers__
  * __Growth factors__
  * __Adrenergic hormones__

__mechanical triggers__

__trophic triggers__

__Induction of genes__

__Production of proteins__

__more proteins and myofilaments per cell__

__more proteins and myofilaments per cell__

__increases the force generated with each contraction__

__meet increased work demands__

__So\, we are happy__

# Mechanisms of Cardiac HypertrophyThings start to change

__switch of contractile proteins from adult to fetal or neonatal forms__

__α\-myosin heavy chain is replaced by the β form of the myosin heavy chain\, which produces slower\, more energetically economical contraction__

* __Then it reaches the limit__
* __Muscle mass cannot compansate the burden__
* __Large proteins are likely to pump less effectively__
* __Degenerative changes start__
  * __Fragmantation__
  * __Loss of fibrillary elements__

__Maybe the vessels are not enough__

__Mitochondria cannot supply ATP properly__

__The synthesis of new proteins are not effective __

# Mechanisms of Cardiac HypertrophyEnd up with

__Huge\, dilated__

__So called “bovine hearth”__

__Cannot pump enough__

__Even cannot pump enough to supply itself__

__Cell injury__

__A vicious circle__

# Adaptations

__Hypertrophy__

<span style="color:#FF0000">Hyperplasia</span>

__Atrophy__

__Metaplasia__

# Hyperplasia

__increase in cell number__

__adaptive response in cells capable of replication__

__Hypertrophy and hyperplasia can occur together__

# Physiologic hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the uterus during pregnancy

# physiologic hyperplasia

__Hormonal Hyperplasia__

__Compensatory hyperplasia__

__Female breast__

__Puberty\, pregnancy__

__proliferation of the glandular epithelium__

__Residual tissue growth__

__After removal or partial loss of organ__

__Liver__

![](./img-local/Cellular-Responses-to-Stress-and-Injury13.jpg)

# Compensatory Hyperplasia of Liver

__One can donate part of liver when \(s\)he is alive__

__Mitosis starts 12 hours later__

__Restore liver to original weight__

__Then proliferation stops__

# Examples of pathologic hyperplasia

* __Endometrial hyperplasia__
  * __Disturbance of the hormonal balance in favor of estrogen over progesterone__

# Hyperplasia in wound healing

__Fibroblasts\, blood vessels proliferate__

__Local effect of mediators from leukocytes__

# Hyperplasia in viral infection

* __Papillomaviruses __
  * __cause skin warts and mucosal lesions__
  * __ masses of hyperplastic epithelium\. __
* __Growth factors may be encoded by viral or infected host cell genes\.__

# Hyperplasia

__The hyperplastic process remains controlled; if the signals that initiate it abate\, the hyperplasia disappears__

__In cancer\, in which the growth control mechanisms become dysregulated or ineffective in many cases__

__Pathologic hyperplasia constitutes a fertile soil in which cancers may eventually arise__

# Hypertrophy vs Hyperplasia

__Hypertrophy__

__Hyperplasia__

_increase in the size of cells_

_increase in the size of the organ_

__no new cells\, just bigger cells__

__increased amount of structural proteins and organelles__

__when cells are incapable of dividing__

* __increase in cell number__
* __adaptive response in cells capable of replication__
  * __\(remember G0\,G1\,S\,M phases of mitosis\)__

# Adaptations

__Hypertrophy__

__Hyperplasia__

<span style="color:#FF0000">Atrophy</span>

__Metaplasia__

# Atrophy

__Shrinkage in the size of the cell__

__by the loss of cell substance__

__After many cells become atrophic tissue and organs become atrophic__

__Cells decrease function\, not dead__

__Normal brain of a young adult__

![](./img-local/Cellular-Responses-to-Stress-and-Injury15.jpg)

__an 82\-year\-old man with atherosclerotic disease\.__

__Atrophy of the brain is due to aging and reduced blood supply__

# Causes of atrophy

* __decreased workload__
  * __immobilization of a limb after fracture__
* __loss of innervation__
* __diminished blood supply__
* __inadequate nutrition__
* __loss of endocrine stimulation__
* __aging \(senile atrophy\)__

# 

__Physiologic atrophy__

__Pathologic atrophy__

* __Decrease in size of uterus__
  * __Decrease hormones after menopouse__

__Denervation atrophy__

__Cellular changes are same__

__Cells get smaller until a point where survival is still possible__

# Mechanism of atrophy

__Decreased protein synthesis__

__Increased protein loss__

__Reduced metabolic activity__

__ubiquitin\-proteasome pathway__

__Nutrient deficiency and disuse activate process__

__Increased catabolism__

# Question to think aboutWhich one is pathologic?

__Hormonal Hyperplasia__

__Hormonal hyperplasia__

__Female breast__

__Increased prolactin in circulation__

__Puberty\, pregnancy__

__proliferation of the glandular epithelium__

__Male breast__

__Increased prolactin in circulation__

__Reason is usually prolactin secreting pituitary tumor__

__Acini are not present in male breast\. Ductules and stroma is affected\.__

# Question to thinkWhich one is pathologic inCompensatory Hyperplasia of Liver

__Hyperplasia after donation__

__Regenerative nodules in cirrhosis__

__One can donate part of liver when \(s\)he is alive__

__Mitosis starts 12 hours later__

__Restore liver to original weight__

__Then proliferation stops__

__3D architecture is preserved__

__After cirrhosis occurs__

__Functional liver cells required__

__Liver cells are capable of dividing__

__They start to divide to compansate__

__Cannot reform the 3D architecture of liver__

# Question to think aboutDoes brain gets hyperplastic/hypertophic changes?

__No__

__Yes__

__With ongoing learning stimuli new connections are being made__

__Brain has ability to plasticize__

__Nerve cells are stabile__

__They do not proliferate__

__They do not increase in size__
