TI  - Subgrading of G2 Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors as 2A (Ki67 3% to < 10%) Versus 
      2B (10% to ≤ 20%) Identifies Behaviorally Distinct Subsets in Keeping with the 
      Evolving Management Protocols.
LID - 10.1245/s10434-024-15632-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Grade 1/2 PanNETs are mostly managed similarly, typically without any 
      adjunct treatment with the belief that their overall metastasis rate is low. In 
      oncology literature, Ki67-index of 10% is increasingly being used as the cutoff 
      in stratifying patients to different protocols, although there are no systematic 
      pathology-based studies supporting this approach. METHODS: Ki67-index was 
      correlated with clinicopathologic parameters in 190 resected PanNETs. A 
      validation cohort (n = 145) was separately analyzed. RESULTS: In initial cohort, 
      maximally selected rank statistics method revealed 12% to be the discriminatory 
      cutoff (close to 10% rule of thumb). G2b cases had liver/distant metastasis rate 
      of almost threefold higher than that of G2a and showed significantly higher 
      frequency of all histopathologic signs of aggressiveness (tumor size, 
      perineural/vascular invasion, infiltrative growth pattern, lymph node 
      metastasis). In validation cohort, these figures were as striking. When all cases 
      were analyzed together, compared with G1, the G2b category had nine times higher 
      liver/distant metastasis rate (6.1 vs. 58.5%; p < 0.001) and three times higher 
      lymph node metastasis rate (20.5 vs. 65.1%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: G2b PanNETs 
      act very similar to G3, supporting management protocols that regard them as 
      potential therapy candidates. Concerning local management, metastatic behavior in 
      G2b cases indicate they may not be as amenable for conservative approaches, such 
      as watchful waiting or enucleation. This substaging should be considered into 
      diagnostic guidelines, and clinical trials need to be devised to determine the 
      more appropriate management protocols for G2b (10% to ≤ 20%) group, which shows 
      liver/distant metastasis in more than half of the cases, which at minimum 
      warrants closer follow-up.

TI  - Intra-ampullary Papillary Tubular Neoplasm (IAPN): Clinicopathologic Analysis of 
      72 Cases Highlights the Distinctive Characteristics of a Poorly Recognized 
      Entity.
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000002275 [doi]
AB  - The guidelines recently recognized the intra-ampullary papillary tubular neoplasm 
      (IAPN) as a distinct tumor entity. However, the data on IAPN and its distinction 
      from other ampullary tumors remain limited. A detailed clinicopathologic analysis 
      of 72 previously unpublished IAPNs was performed. The patients were: 
      male/female=1.8; mean age=67 years (range: 42 to 86 y); mean size=2.3 cm. 
      Gross-microscopic correlation was crucial. From the duodenal perspective, the 
      ampulla was typically raised symmetrically, with a patulous orifice, and was 
      otherwise covered by stretched normal duodenal mucosa. However, in 6 cases, the 
      protrusion of the intra-ampullary tumor to the duodenal surface gave the 
      impression of an "ampullary-duodenal tumor," with the accurate diagnosis of IAPN 
      established only by microscopic correlation illustrating the abrupt ending of the 
      lesion at the edge of the ampulla. Microscopically, the preinvasive component 
      often revealed mixed phenotypes (44.4% predominantly nonintestinal). The invasion 
      was common (94%), typically small (mean=1.2 cm), primarily pancreatobiliary-type 
      (75%), and showed aggressive features (lymphovascular invasion in 66%, perineural 
      invasion in 41%, high budding in 30%). In 6 cases, the preinvasive component was 
      pure intestinal, but the invasive component was pancreatobiliary. LN metastasis 
      was identified in 42% (32% in ≤1 cm IAPNs). The prognosis was significantly 
      better than ampullary-ductal carcinomas (median: 69 vs. 41 months; 3-year: 68% 
      vs. 55%; and 5-year: 51% vs. 35%, P=0.047). Unlike ampullary-duodenal carcinomas, 
      IAPNs are often (44.4%) predominantly nonintestinal and commonly (94%) invasive, 
      displaying aggressive features and LN metastasis even when minimally invasive, 
      all of which render them less amenable to ampullectomy. However, their prognosis 
      is still better than that of the "ampullary-ductal" carcinomas, with which IAPNs 
      are currently grouped in CAP protocols (while IAPNs are kindreds of intraductal 
      tumors of the pancreatobiliary tract, the latter represents the ampullary 
      counterpart of pancreatic adenocarcinoma/cholangiocarcinoma).

TI  - Clinicopathological analysis of 38 male patients diagnosed with breast cancer.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.3233/BD-230050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) accounts for one percent of all breast 
      cancers. Due to the lack of awareness and routine screening programs, most 
      patients present with systemic disease at the time of diagnosis with low overall 
      survival. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the prognostic factors of 
      male breast cancer and its correlation with established prognostic parameters and 
      patient outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-eight male breast cancer patients are 
      identified from the MKA Breast Cancer Clinic database, and their corresponding 
      clinical and pathological characteristics are obtained. Cut-off values of 1% and 
      10% are applied to further classify ER and PR results. RESULTS: Older men are 
      more likely to develop MBC than younger men and are more likely to have spread to 
      axillary lymph nodes. Invasive ductal carcinoma is a more common histologic type 
      in MBC. All the tested patients have ER and PR positivity. Distant metastasis 
      developed in 17/38 (44.7%) patients. Bone metastasis is seen commonly in 
      metastatic MBC. CONCLUSIONS: According to our cohort, MBC is seen in older males, 
      presents in later stages, and shows hormone receptor positivity and a tendency to 
      bone involvement. MBC is a heterogenous but distinct biological entity requiring 
      a specific clinical and pathological approach.

TI  - Adenomyomas of the Gallbladder: An Analysis of Frequency, Clinicopathologic 
      Associations, and Relationship to Carcinoma of a Malformative Lesion.
PG  - 206-214
LID - 10.5858/arpa.2022-0379-OA [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT.—: The nature and associations of gallbladder (GB) "adenomyoma" (AM) 
      remain controversial. Some studies have attributed up to 26% of GB carcinoma to 
      AMs. OBJECTIVE.—: To examine the true frequency, clinicopathologic 
      characteristics, and neoplastic changes in GB AM. DESIGN.—: Cholecystectomy 
      cohorts analyzed were 1953 consecutive cases, prospectively with specific 
      attention to AM; 2347 consecutive archival cases; 203 totally embedded GBs; 207 
      GBs with carcinoma; and archival search of institutions for all cases diagnosed 
      as AM. RESULTS.—: Frequency of AM was 9.3% (19 of 203) in totally submitted cases 
      but 3.3% (77 of 2347) in routinely sampled archival tissue. A total of 283 AMs 
      were identified, with a female to male ratio = 1.9 (177:94) and mean size = 1.3 
      cm (range, 0.3-5.9). Most (96%, 203 of 210) were fundic, with formed nodular 
      trabeculated submucosal thickening, and were difficult to appreciate from the 
      mucosal surface. Four of 257 were multifocal (1.6%), and 3 of 257 (1.2%) were 
      extensive ("adenomyomatosis"). Dilated glands (up to 14 mm), often radially 
      converging to a point in the mucosa, were typical. Muscle was often minimal, 
      confined to the upper segment. Nine of 225 (4%) revealed features of a 
      duplication. No specific associations with inflammation, cholesterolosis, 
      intestinal metaplasia, or thickening of the uninvolved GB wall were identified. 
      Neoplastic change arising in AM was seen in 9.9% (28 of 283). Sixteen of 283 
      (5.6%) had mural intracholecystic neoplasm; 7 of 283 (2.5%) had flat-type 
      high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ. Thirteen of 283 cases had both AM and 
      invasive carcinoma (4.6%), but in only 5 of 283 (1.8%), carcinoma arose from AM 
      (invasion was confined to AM, and dysplasia was predominantly in AM). 
      CONCLUSIONS.—: AMs have all the features of a malformative developmental lesion, 
      and may not show a significant muscle component (ie, the name "adeno-myoma" is 
      partly a misnomer). While most are innocuous, some pathologies may arise in AMs, 
      including intracholecystic neoplasms, flat-type high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma 
      in situ, and invasive carcinoma (1.8%, 5 of 283). It is recommended that gross 
      examination of GBs include serial slicing of the fundus for AM detection and 
      total submission if one is found.

TI  - Tumoral Intraductal Neoplasms of the Bile Ducts Comprise Morphologically and 
      Genetically Distinct Entities.
PG  - 1390-1401

AB  - CONTEXT.—: Tumoral (grossly visible) intraductal neoplasms of the bile ducts are 
      still being characterized. OBJECTIVE.—: To investigate their morphologic, 
      immunohistochemical, and molecular features. DESIGN.—: Forty-one cases were 
      classified as gastric-, intestinal-, pancreatobiliary-type intraductal papillary 
      neoplasm (IPN), intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm (IOPN), or intraductal 
      tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) on the basis of histology. All neoplasms were 
      subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing. RESULTS.—: The mean age at 
      diagnosis was 69 years (42-81 years); male to female ratio was 1.3. Most 
      neoplasms (n = 23, 56%) were extrahepatic/large (mean size, 4.6 cm). The majority 
      (n = 32, 78%) contained high-grade dysplasia, and 68% (n = 28) revealed invasion. 
      All gastric-type IPNs (n = 9) and most ITPNs/IOPNs showed consistent colabeling 
      for CK7/MUC6, which was less common among others (P = .004). Intestinal-type IPNs 
      (n = 5) showed higher rates of CK20 expression than others (P < .001). Overall, 
      the most commonly mutated genes included TP53 and APC, while copy number variants 
      affected ELF3 and CDKN2A/B. All gastric-type IPNs contained an alteration 
      affecting the Wnt signaling pathway; 7 of 9 (78%) showed aberrations in the MAPK 
      pathway. Mutations in APC and KRAS were common in gastric-type IPNs as compared 
      with others (P = .01 for both). SMAD4 was more frequently mutated in 
      intestinal-type IPNs (P = .02). Pancreatobiliary-type IPNs (n = 14) exhibited 
      frequent alterations in tumor suppressor genes including TP53, CDKN2A/B, and 
      ARID2 (P = .04, P = .01 and P = .002, respectively). Of 6 IOPNs analyzed, 3 (50%) 
      revealed ATP1B1-PRKACB fusion. ITPNs (n = 6) showed relatively few recurrent 
      genetic aberrations. Follow-up information was available for 38 patients (median, 
      58.5 months). The ratio of disease-related deaths was higher for the cases with 
      invasion (56% versus 10%). CONCLUSIONS.—: Tumoral intraductal neoplasms of the 
      bile ducts, similar to their counterparts in the pancreas, are morphologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous.

TI  - Reappraisal of T1b gallbladder cancer (GBC): clinicopathologic analysis of 473 in 
      situ and invasive GBCs and critical review of the literature highlights its 
      rarity, and that it has a very good prognosis.
PG  - 311-323
LID - 10.1007/s00428-022-03482-6 [doi]
AB  - There are highly conflicting data on relative frequency (2-32%), prognosis, and 
      management of pT1b-gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), with 5-year survival ranging 
      from > 90% in East/Chile where cholecystectomy is regarded as curative, 
      versus < 50% in the West, with radical operations post-cholecystectomy being 
      recommended by guidelines. A total of 473 in situ and invasive extensively 
      sampled GBCs from the USA (n = 225) and Chile (n = 248) were re-evaluated 
      histopathologically per Western invasiveness criteria. 349 had invasive 
      carcinoma, and only 24 were pT1. Seven cases previously staged as pT1b were 
      re-classified as pT2. There were 19 cases (5% of all invasive GBCs) qualified as 
      pT1b and most pT1b carcinomas were minute (< 1mm). One patient with extensive 
      pTis at margins (but pT1b focus away from the margins) died of GBC at 27 months, 
      two died of other causes, and the remainder were alive without disease (median 
      follow-up 69.9 months; 5-year disease-specific survival, 92%). In conclusion, 
      careful pathologic analysis of well-sampled cases reveals that only 5% of 
      invasive GBCs are pT1b, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of > 90%, similar 
      to findings in the East. This supports the inclusion of pT1b in the "early GBC" 
      category, as is typically done in high-incidence regions. Pathologic mis-staging 
      of pT2 as pT1 is not uncommon. Cases should not be classified as pT1b unless 
      extensive, preferably total, sampling of the gallbladder to rule out a subtle pT2 
      is performed. Critical appraisal of the literature reveals that the Western 
      guidelines are based on either SEER or mis-interpretation of stage IB cases as 
      "pT1b." Although the prognosis of pT1b-GBC is very good, additional surgery 
      (radical cholecystectomy) may be indicated, and long-term surveillance of the 
      biliary tract is warranted.

TI  - Medullary carcinoma of the ampulla has distinct clinicopathologic characteristics 
      including common association with microsatellite instability and PD-L1 
      expression.

AB  - Medullary carcinomas have not yet been fully characterized in the ampulla. Here, 
      359 ampullary carcinomas (ACs) were reviewed and 11 medullary-type carcinomas 
      (3%) were found and analyzed. In addition to the diagnostic medullary pattern, 6 
      showed focal mucinous and 8 had focal abortive gland-like formations. They 
      occurred in younger patients (57 versus 65 y; P = .02), had larger invasion size 
      (mean, 3.2 versus 1.9 cm; P = .01), formed nodular polypoid or plaque-like 
      tumors, and often lacked preinvasive component. In addition to the 
      lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, they also had prominent eosinophils in 5 of 11 
      cases. Eight were papilla Vateri-NOS (not otherwise specified) tumors, 2 were 
      ampullary-duodenal origin, 1 had a minor intra-ampullary papillary tubular 
      neoplasm component, and none were ampullary-ductal. Although they had 
      pushing-border infiltration, perineural and vascular invasion was common. They 
      were strongly associated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein deficient (7/11, 
      64%). The 5-yr survival rate (53%) appeared to be comparable with, and perhaps 
      even better than that of nonmedullary ACs (47%), although this did not reach 
      statistical significance (P = .47). Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) 
      expression levels were assessed in 8, and all 4 that were MMR deficient were 
      positive both by combined positive score (CPS) ≥1 and tumor proportion score 
      (TPS) ≥1, and of the 4 MMR proficient cases, 3 were positive by CPS; 2 by TPS. 
      Overall, only 1 of the 8 available for analysis failed to show PD-L1 positivity 
      by CPS. In contrast, nonmedullary MMR-deficient carcinomas expressed PD-L1 in 
      only 33% of tumors by CPS, and none by TPS. One medullary carcinoma was also EBV 
      associated. Unlike 'medullary carcinomas' of the kidney, INI1 was retained in all 
      8 cases tested. In conclusion, medullary carcinomas are 3% of ACs, have a strong 
      association with MMR-D, and may be less aggressive despite their larger size. 
      PD-L1 expression appears to be closely associated with medullary ACs regardless 
      of MMR status, and thus targeted therapies can be considered for all medullary 
      carcinomas of this site.

AB  - The literature on liver cysts is highly conflicting, mostly owing to definitional 
      variations. Two hundred and fifty-eight ≥1 cm cysts evaluated pathologically 
      using updated criteria were classifiable as: I. Ductal plate malformation related 
      (63%); that is, cystic bile duct hamartoma or not otherwise specified-type benign 
      biliary cyst (35 with polycystic liver disease). These were female predominant 
      (F/M=2.4), large (10 cm), often multifocal with degenerative/inflammatory changes 
      and frequently misclassified as "hepatobiliary cystadenoma." II. Neoplastic 
      (13%); 27 (10.5%) had ovarian-type stroma (OTS) and qualified as mucinous cystic 
      neoplasm (MCN) per World Health Organization (WHO). These were female, solitary, 
      mean age 52, mean size 11 cm, and 2 were associated with carcinoma (1 in situ and 
      1 microinvasive). There were 3 intraductal papillary neoplasms, 1 intraductal 
      oncocytic papillary neoplasm, 1 cystic cholangiocarcinoma, and 2 cystic 
      metastasis. III. Infectious/inflammatory (12%). These included 23 hydatid cysts 
      (including 2 Echinococcus alveolaris both misdiagnosed preoperatively as cancer), 
      nonspecific inflammatory cysts (abscesses, inflammatory cysts: 3.4%). IV. 
      Congenital (7%). Mostly small (<3 cm); choledochal cyst (5%), foregut cyst (2%). 
      V. Miscellaneous (4%). In conclusion, hepatic cysts occur predominantly in women 
      (3/1), are mostly (90%) non-neoplastic, and seldom (<2%) malignant. Cystic bile 
      duct hamartomas and their relative not otherwise specified-type benign biliary 
      cysts are frequently multifocal and often misdiagnosed as 
      "cystadenoma/carcinoma." Defined by OTS, MCNs (the true "hepatobiliary 
      cystadenoma/carcinoma") are solitary, constitute only 10.5% of hepatic cysts, and 
      have a significantly different profile than the impression in the literature in 
      that essentially all are perimenopausal females, and rarely associated with 
      carcinoma (7%). Since MCNs can only be diagnosed by demonstration of OTS through 
      complete microscopic examination, it is advisable to avoid the term 
      "cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma" solely based on radiologic examination, and the 
      following simplified terminology would be preferable in preoperative evaluation 
      to avoid conflicts with the final pathologic diagnosis: (1) noncomplex (favor 
      benign), (2) complex (in 3 subsets, as favor benign, cannot rule out malignancy, 
      or favor malignancy), (3) malignant features.

TI  - Infiltration pattern predicts metastasis and progression better than the T-stage 
      and grade in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a proposal for a novel 
      infiltration-based morphologic grading.
PG  - 777-785

AB  - The advancing edge profile is a powerful determinant of tumor behavior in many 
      organs. In this study, a grading system assessing the tumor-host interface was 
      developed and tested in 181 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), 63 of 
      which were <=2 cm. Three tumor slides representative of the spectrum (least, 
      medium, and most) of invasiveness at the advancing edge of the tumor were 
      selected, and then each slide was scored as follows. 
      Well-demarcated/encapsulated, 1 point; Mildly irregular borders and/or minimal 
      infiltration into adjacent tissue, 2 points; Infiltrative edges with several 
      clusters beyond the main tumor but still relatively close, and/or satellite 
      demarcated nodules, 3 points; No demarcation, several cellular clusters away from 
      the tumor, 4 points; Exuberantly infiltrative pattern, scirrhous growth, 
      dissecting the normal parenchymal elements, 5 points. The sum of the rankings on 
      the three slides was obtained. Cases with scores of 3-6 were defined as 
      "non/minimally infiltrative" (NI; n = 77), 7-9 as "moderately infiltrative" (MI; 
      n = 68), and 10-15 as "highly infiltrative" (HI; n = 36). In addition to showing 
      a statistically significant correlation with all the established signs of 
      aggressiveness (grade, size, T-stage), this grading system was found to be the 
      most significant predictor of adverse outcomes (metastasis, progression, and 
      death) on multivariate analysis, more strongly than T-stage, while Ki-67 index 
      did not stand the multivariate test. As importantly, cases <=2 cm were also 
      stratified by this grading system rendering it applicable also to this group that 
      is currently placed in "watchful waiting" protocols. In conclusion, the proposed 
      grading system has a strong, independent prognostic value and therefore should be 
      considered for integration into routine pathology practice after being evaluated 
      in validation studies with larger series.

TI  - T2 gallbladder cancer shows substantial survival variation between continents and 
      this is not due to histopathologic criteria or pathologic sampling differences.
PG  - 875-884
LID - 10.1007/s00428-020-02968-5 [doi]
AB  - Published data on survival of T2 gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) from different 
      countries show a wide range of 5-year survival rates from 30-> 70%. Recently, 
      studies have demonstrated substantial variation between countries in terms of 
      their approach to sampling gallbladders, and furthermore, that pathologists from 
      different continents apply highly variable criteria in determining stage of 
      invasion in this organ. These findings raised the question of whether these 
      variations in pathologic evaluation could account for the vastly different 
      survival rates of T2 GBC reported in the literature. In this study, survival of 
      316 GBCs from three countries (Chile n = 137, South Korea n = 105, USA n = 74), 
      all adequately sampled (with a minimum of five tumor sections examined) and 
      histopathologically verified as pT2 (after consensus examination by expert 
      pathologists from three continents), was analyzed. Chilean patients had a 
      significantly worse prognosis based on 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.89, 95% 
      CI: 1.27-2.83, p = 0.002) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 
      1.51-3.84, p < 0.001), compared to their South Korean counterparts, even when 
      controlled for age and sex. Comparing the USA to South Korea, the survival 
      differences in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75, p = 0.015) and 
      disease-specific mortality (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.14-3.31, p = 0.015) were also 
      pronounced. The 3-year disease-specific survival rates in South Korea, the USA, 
      and Chile were 75%, 65%, and 55%, respectively, the 5-year disease-specific 
      survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 50%, respectively, and the overall 5-year 
      survival rates were 55%, 45%, and 35%, respectively. In conclusion, the survival 
      of true T2 GBC in properly classified cases is neither as good nor as bad as 
      previously documented in the literature and shows notable geographic differences 
      even in well-sampled cases with consensus histopathologic criteria. Future 
      studies should focus on other potential reasons including biologic, 
      etiopathogenetic, management-related, populational, or healthcare 
      practice-related factors that may influence the survival differences of T2 GBC in 
      different regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Different perspectives exist regarding the clinicopathologic 
      characteristics, biology and management of gallbladder polyps. Size is often used 
      as the surrogate evidence of polyp behavior and size of ≥1cm is widely used as 
      cholecystectomy indication. Most studies on this issue are based on the 
      pathologic correlation of polyps clinically selected for resection, whereas, the 
      data regarding the nature of polypoid lesions from pathology perspective 
      -regardless of the cholecystectomy indication- is highly limited. METHODS: In 
      this study, 4231 gallbladders -606 of which had gallbladder carcinoma- were 
      reviewed carefully pathologically by the authors for polyps (defined as ≥2 mm). 
      Separately, the cases that were diagnosed as "gallbladder polyps" in the surgical 
      pathology databases were retrieved. RESULTS: 643 polyps identified accordingly 
      were re-evaluated histopathologically. Mean age of all patients was 55 years 
      (range: 20-94); mean polyp size was 9 mm. Among these 643 polyps, 223 (34.6%) 
      were neoplastic: I. Non-neoplastic polyps (n = 420; 65.4%) were smaller (mean: 
      4.1 mm), occurred in younger patients (mean: 52 years). This group consisted of 
      fibromyoglandular polyps (n = 196) per the updated classification, cholesterol 
      polyps (n = 166), polypoid pyloric gland metaplasia (n = 41) and inflammatory 
      polyps (n = 17). II. Neoplastic polyps were larger (mean: 21 mm), detected in 
      older patients (mean: 61 years) and consisted of intra-cholecystic neoplasms 
      (WHO's "adenomas" and "intracholecystic papillary neoplasms", ≥1 cm; n = 120), 
      their "incipient" version (<1 cm) (n = 44), polypoid invasive carcinomas (n = 26) 
      and non-neoplastic polyps with incidental dysplastic changes (n = 33). In terms 
      of size cut-off correlations, overall, only 27% of polyps were ≥1 cm, 90% of 
      which were neoplastic. All (except for one) ≥2 cm were neoplastic. However, 14% 
      of polyps <1 cm were also neoplastic. Positive predictive value of ≥1 cm cut-off 
      -which is widely used for cholecystectomy indication-, was 94.3% and negative 
      predictive value was 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately a third of polypoid lesions 
      in the cholecystectomies (regardless of the indication) prove to be neoplastic. 
      The vast majority of (90%) of polyps ≥1 cm and virtually all of those ≥2 cm are 
      neoplastic confirming the current impression that polyps ≥1 cm ought to be 
      removed. However, this study also illustrates that 30% of the neoplastic polyps 
      are <1 cm and therefore small polyps should also be closely watched, especially 
      in older patients.

TI  - Frequency and clinicopathologic associations of DNA mismatch repair protein 
      deficiency in ampullary carcinoma: Routine testing is indicated.
PG  - 4788-4799
LID - 10.1002/cncr.33135 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The significance of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in ampullary 
      cancers (ACs) has not been established. METHODS: In total, 127 ACs with invasive 
      carcinomas measuring ≥3 mmthat had adequate tissue were analyzed 
      immunohistochemically. RESULTS: MMR loss was detected in 18% of ACs (higher than 
      in colorectal cancers). Twelve tumors with MLH1-PMS2 loss were negative for BRAF 
      V600E mutation, suggesting a Lynch syndrome association. MMR-deficient tumors 
      (n = 23), comparedwith MMR-intact tumors (n = 104), showed a striking male 
      predominance (male:female ratio, 4.7). Although the deficient tumors had slightly 
      larger invasion size (2.7 vs 2.1 cm), they also had more expansile growth and 
      less invasiveness, including less perineural invasion, and they ultimately had 
      lower tumor (T) classification and less lymph node metastasis (30% vs 53%; 
      P = .04). More important, patients who had MMR-deficient tumors had better 
      clinical outcomes, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 68% versus 45% 
      (P = .03), which was even more pronounced in those who had higher Tclassification 
      (5-year overall survival, 69% vs 34%; P = .04). MMR deficiencyhad a statistically 
      significant association with medullary phenotype, pushing-border invasion, and 
      tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and it occurred more frequently in 
      ampullary-duodenal type tumors. Programed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels 
      analyzed in the 22 MMR-deficient ACs revealed that all medullary carcinomas were 
      positive. Nonmedullary MMR-deficient carcinomas expressed PD-L1 in 33% of tumors 
      cells according to the criteria for a combined positive score ≥1, but all were 
      negative according to the tumor proportion score≥1 method. CONCLUSIONS: In ACs, 
      MMR deficiency is even more frequent (18%) than in colon cancer and often has a 
      Lynch-suggestive profile, thus routine testing is warranted. Male gender, 
      pushing-border infiltration, ampullary-duodenal origin, medullary histology, and 
      tumor-related inflammation have a significantly higher association with MMR 
      deficiency. MMR-deficient tumors have less aggressive behavior. PD-L1 expression 
      is common in medullary-phenotype ACs, thus immunotherapy should be considered at 
      least for this group.

TI  - Intracholecystic tubular non-mucinous neoplasm (ICTN) of the gallbladder: a 
      clinicopathologically distinct, invasion-resistant entity.
PG  - 435-447
LID - 10.1007/s00428-020-02877-7 [doi]
AB  - Preinvasive tumor-forming gallbladder neoplasms that are composed of small, 
      non-mucinous tubules with complex architecture remain a poorly characterized 
      group. Here, we evaluated the clinicopathological characteristics of this entity. 
      Twenty-eight examples were analyzed. Tumors were invariably pedunculated polyps 
      with thin stalks, often presented as loosely attached intraluminal nodules, with 
      cauliflower architecture (akin to cholesterol polyps) comprised of compact, 
      back-to-back acinar-like, small tubular units with minimal/no cytoplasm showing 
      variable complexity, creating a picture distinct from the other tubular type 
      dysplasia in the gallbladder. Their limited stroma showed distinctive amorphous 
      amyloid-like hyalinization (39%). While some had round nuclei with single 
      prominent nucleoli, others exhibited slightly more elongated nuclei with washed 
      out chromatin reminiscent of papillary thyroid carcinoma. 
      Squamoid/meningothelial-like morules (71%) and subtle neuroendocrine cell 
      clusters (39%) were frequent. The level of cytoarchitectural atypia qualified as 
      high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in all cases, but none were invasive. The background 
      mucosa showed no dysplasia, but cholesterolosis. The majority (n = 8/12) showed 
      diffuse MUC6 expression and lacked MUC5AC expression. Based on these 
      observations, 635 gallbladder carcinomas were re-analyzed for residual/adjacent 
      lesions with entity-defining characteristics disclosed here, and none could be 
      identified. Preinvasive tubular non-mucinous neoplasm of the gallbladder, which 
      we propose to classify as intracholecystic tubular non-mucinous neoplasm, is a 
      clinicopathologically discrete entity, which tends to occur in uninjured 
      gallbladders and in association with cholesterol polyps. By being tubular, 
      non-mucinous and MUC6-positive, it is akin to intraductal tubulopapillary 
      neoplasms of pancreatobiliary tract, but it is also different in many other 
      aspects. Although their cytoarchitectural complexity warrants an HGD/carcinoma 
      classification, they do not show invasion and their distinct characteristics 
      warrant their separate classification.

TI  - Follicular Cholecystitis: Reappraisal of Incidence, Definition, and 
      Clinicopathologic Associations in an Analysis of 2550 Cholecystectomies.
PG  - 826-834
LID - 10.1177/1066896920924079 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT. Follicular cholecystitis (FC) is a poorly characterized entity. 
      OBJECTIVE. To determine its frequency/clinicopathologic associations. DESIGN. A 
      total of 2550 cholecystectomy specimens were examined. Two hundred three of these 
      were consecutive routine cholecystectomies submitted entirely for microscopic 
      examination to determine the relative frequency of incidental pathologies in 
      gallbladders (GBs). The remainder had representative sampling. Underlying 
      conditions were nonobstructive pathologies (1270 nonspecific cholecystitis), 
      obstructive (62 distal biliary tract tumors, 35 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 
      and 31 autoimmune pancreatitis), and neoplastic (n = 949). FC was defined as 3 
      distinct lymphoid follicles (LFs)/centimeter. RESULTS. In the GBs totally 
      submitted for microscopic examination, the true frequency of FC was found to be 
      2.5% (5/203), and in the representatively sampled group, it was 1.9%, with 
      similar frequencies in nonobstructive, obstructive, and neoplastic cases (2.3%, 
      3.1%, and 1.3%, respectively, P = .77). When the 39 FC in nonneoplastic GBs 
      contrasted with ordinary chronic cholecystitis, they were associated with older 
      age (68 vs 49 years, P < .0001), similar gallstone frequency (68 vs 81%), 
      female/male ratio (2.7 vs 2.6), and wall thickness (4 mm for both). None had 
      lymphoma/parasites/Salmonella infection. Of 17 cases who had undergone gastric 
      biopsy, 5 had chronic gastritis (2 with Helicobacter pylori). Microscopically, 
      the LFs were the main inflammatory process often with minimal intervening 
      inflammation. IgG4-positive plasma cell density was low (<10/high-power field) in 
      21/24(87.5%) cases. CONCLUSIONS. Follicular cholecystitis is seen in 2% of 
      cholecystectomies, typically in significantly older patients, suggesting a 
      deranged immune response. A third of the patients reveal biopsy-proven gastritis. 
      FC does not seem to be associated with autoimmunity, lymphoma, or obstructive 
      pathologies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cholecystectomy materials are frequently encountered in routine 
      practice. The aim of this study was to determine the true frequency of 
      gallbladder lesions, the diagnostic consistency, and standardization of reports 
      after macroscopic sampling and microscopic evaluation based on previously defined 
      criteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 14 institutions participated in the study within 
      the Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Pathology Study Group. Routinely examined 
      cholecystectomies within the last year were included in the study in these 
      institutions. Additional sampling was performed according to the indications and 
      criteria. The number of blocks and samples taken in the first macroscopic 
      examination and the number of blocks and samples taken in the additional sampling 
      were determined and the rate of diagnostic contribution of the additional 
      examination was determined. RESULTS: A total of 5,244 cholecystectomy materials 
      from 14 institutions were included in the study. Additional sampling was found to 
      be necessary in 576 cases (10.98%) from all institutions. In the first 
      macroscopic sampling, the mean of the numbers of samples was approximately 4 and 
      the number of blocks was 2. The mean of the numbers of additional samples and 
      blocks was approximately 8 and 4, respectively. The diagnosis was changed in 144 
      of the 576 new sampled cases while the remaining 432 stayed unaltered. 
      CONCLUSION: In this study, it was observed that new sampling after the first 
      microscopic examination of cholecystectomy materials contributed to the 
      diagnosis. It was also shown that the necessity of having standard criteria for 
      macroscopic and microscopic examination plays an important role in making the 
      correct diagnosis.

TI  - Non-neoplastic Polyps of the Gallbladder: A Clinicopathologic Analysis of 447 
      Cases.

LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001405 [doi]
AB  - There is no systematic histopathologic analysis of non-neoplastic polyps in the 
      gallbladder. In this study, in addition to a computer search for cases designated 
      as "polyp," a systematic review of 2533 consecutive routinely sampled archival 
      and 203 totally submitted prospective cholecystectomies were analyzed for >2 mm 
      polyps (cut-off was based on radiologic sensitivity). A total of 447 
      non-neoplastic polyps were identified. The frequency was 3% in archival cases and 
      5% in totally submitted cases. Only 21 (5%) were ≥1 cm. The average age was 52 
      years, and the female to male ratio was 3.1. Two distinct categories were 
      delineated: (1) injury-related polyps (n=273): (a) Fibro(myo)glandular polyps 
      (n=214) were small (mean=0.4 cm), broad-based, often multiple (45%), almost 
      always (98%) gallstone-associated, and were composed of a mixture of 
      (myo)fibroblastic tissue/lobular glandular units with chronic cholecystitis. 
      Dysplasia seen in 9% seemed to be secondary involvement. (b) Metaplastic pyloric 
      glands forming polypoid collections (n=42). (c) Inflammatory-type polyps 
      associated with acute/subacute injury (11 granulation tissue, 3 
      xanthogranulomatous, 3 lymphoid). (2) Cholesterol polyps (n=174) occurred in 
      uninjured gallbladders, revealing a very thin stalk, edematous cores devoid of 
      glands but with cholesterol-laden macrophages in 85%, and cholesterolosis in the 
      uninvolved mucosa in 60%. Focal low-grade dysplasia was seen in 3%, always 
      confined to the polyp, unaccompanied by carcinoma. In conclusion, non-neoplastic 
      polyps are seen in 3% of cholecystectomies and are often small. Injury-related 
      fibromyoglandular polyps are the most common. Cholesterol polyps have distinctive 
      cauliflower architecture, often in a background of uninjured gallbladders with 
      cholesterolosis and may lack the cholesterol-laden macrophages in the polyp 
      itself. Although dysplastic changes can involve non-neoplastic polyps, they do 
      not seem to be the cause of invasive carcinoma by themselves.

PG  - 236-244
LID - 10.1177/1066896919880968 [doi]
AB  - In the ampulla of Vater, carcinomas with "diffuse-infiltrative"/"signet ring 
      cell" morphology, designated as "poorly cohesive carcinoma" (PCC) in the WHO 
      classification, are very rare and poorly characterized. Nine cases with a 
      classical PCC morphology constituting >50% of the tumor were identified. Mean age 
      was 64.8 years (vs 64.6 in ampullary carcinomas [ACs]) and 6 were males, 3 
      females. The mean invasive tumor size was 2.5 cm (vs 1.9 in ACs). Other 
      morphologic patterns displayed included cord-like infiltration (n=2), 
      plasmacytoid cells (n=2), and microglandular component (n=4), including goblet 
      cell adenocarcinoma-like foci. None of the cases were associated with dysplasia. 
      By immunohistochemistry, the carcinomas did not show intestinal differentiation 
      (CDX2 0/9, CK20 1/9, MUC2 3/9), MUC1 was positive in 4/9, MUC5AC was positive in 
      7/8. E-cadherin loss was noted in 4/9. All cases were advanced stage (6/9-pT3, 
      3/9-pT4) (vs 43% in ACs). Lymph node metastases were identified in 44% (vs 45% in 
      AC). Six patients (67%) died of disease at a median of 25 months, 3 were alive at 
      13, 15, and 60 months. Overall median survival was significantly worse than that 
      of intestinal-type ACs (26 vs 122 months, P = .006) and trended toward worse than 
      pancreatobiliary type (26 vs 42 months, P = .1). In conclusion, PCCs constitute 
      2.45% of all ACs. These present as advanced tumors and express 
      upper-gastrointestinal immunoprofile with frequent MUC5AC labeling, which may be 
      helpful in identifying subtle infiltration in the surface mucosa since MUC5AC is 
      not expressed in the ampullary mucosa. Patients have poor prognosis.

TI  - Sarcomatoid carcinomas of the gallbladder: clinicopathologic characteristics.
PG  - 59-66
LID - 10.1007/s00428-019-02583-z [doi]
AB  - Sarcomatoid carcinomas recently came into the spotlight through genetic profiling 
      studies and also as a distinct model of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The 
      literature on sarcomatoid carcinomas of gallbladder is limited. In this study, 
      656 gallbladder carcinomas (GBC) were reviewed. Eleven (1.7%) with a sarcomatoid 
      component were identified and analyzed in comparison with ordinary GBC (O-GBC). 
      Patients included 9 females and 2 males (F/M = 4.5 vs. 3.9) with a mean 
      age-at-diagnosis of 71 (vs. 64). The median tumor size was 4.6 cm (vs. 2.5; 
      P = 0.01). Nine patients (84%) presented with advanced stage (pT3/4) tumor (vs. 
      48%). An adenocarcinoma component constituting 1-75% of the tumor was present in 
      nine, and eight had surface dysplasia/CIS; either in situ or invasive carcinoma 
      was present in all cases. An intracholecystic papillary-tubular neoplasm was 
      identified in one. Seven showed pleomorphic-sarcomatoid pattern, and four showed 
      subtle/bland elongated spindle cells. Three had an angiosarcomatoid pattern. Two 
      had heterologous elements. One showed few osteoclast-like giant cells, only 
      adjacent to osteoid. Immunohistochemically, vimentin, was positive in six of six; 
      P53 expression was > 60% in six of six, keratins in six of seven, and p63 in two 
      of six. Actin, desmin, and S100 were negative. The median Ki67 index was 40%. In 
      the follow-up, one died peri-operatively, eight died of disease within 3 to 
      8 months (vs. 26 months median survival for O-GBC), and two were alive at 9 and 
      15 months. The behavior overall was worse than ordinary adenocarcinomas in 
      general but was not different when grade and stage were matched. In summary, 
      sarcomatoid component is identified in < 2% of GBC. Unlike sarcomatoid carcinomas 
      in the remainder of pancreatobiliary tract, these are seldom of the 
      "osteoclastic" type and patients present with large/advanced stage tumors. 
      Limited data suggests that these tumors are aggressive with rapid mortality 
      unlike pancreatic osteoclastic ones which often have indolent behavior.

TI  - Role of calcium-sensing receptor, Galectin-3, Cyclin D1, and Ki-67 
      immunohistochemistry to favor in the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma.
PG  - 22-26
LID - 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_85_17 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As histopathological findings of parathyroid carcinoma are not 
      certain, the diagnosis of tumors with degenerative changes may be difficult. In 
      these cases, immunohistochemical markers are beneficial. We aimed to research the 
      acceptability of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), Galactin-3, Cyclin D1, and 
      Ki-67 as helpful markers in parathyroid tumors in cases which are difficult to 
      diagnose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Those cases who had been diagnosed with atypical 
      parathyroid adenoma and parathyroid carcinoma between 2010 and 2015 were 
      reevaluated. İmmunohistochemical markers were applied to this cases. RESULTS: 
      About 21 cases were parathyroid adenoma, 14 were atypical adenoma, and 10 cases 
      were parathyroid carcinoma. According to the immunohistochemical results, global 
      loss of CaSR staining was seen in 50% (5/10) of the patients with carcinoma while 
      there was no loss of staining in those with parathyroid adenoma (P = 0,001). 
      Global loss of CaSR staining was found in only one out of 14 cases with atypical 
      adenoma. The expression of Galactin-3 was found to be positive in 40% (4/10) of 
      carcinoma cases, 71.4% (10/14) of those with atypical adenoma, and 14.3% (3/21) 
      of those with adenoma (P = 0,002). Cyclin D1 expression was determined to be 
      positive in 70% (7/10) of patients with carcinoma, 71.4% (10/14) of atypical 
      adenoma cases, and 23.8% (5/21) of those with adenoma. The Ki-67 proliferation 
      index was seen to be above 5% in 50% (5/10) of carcinoma cases and 35,7% (5/14) 
      of those with atypical adenoma. CONCLUSION: In these studies, it has been 
      emphasized that the global loss of CaSR staining was used as a negative marker in 
      the diagnosis of carcinoma. In this study, we have also confirmed that the global 
      loss of CaSR staining is a useful marker to determine potential increased 
      malignancy.

TI  - A Retrospective Evaluation of the Epithelial Changes/Lesions and Neoplasms of the 
      Gallbladder in Turkey and a Review of the Existing Sampling Methods: A 
      Multicentre Study.
PG  - 41-48
LID - 10.5146/tjpath.2017.01404 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As there is continuing disagreement among the observers on the 
      differential diagnosis between the epithelial changes/lesions and neoplasms of 
      the gallbladder, this multicentre study was planned in order to assess the rate 
      of the epithelial gallbladder lesions in Turkey and to propose microscopy and 
      macroscopy protocols. MATERIAL AND METHOD: With the participation of 22 
      institutions around Turkey that were included in the Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary 
      Study Group, 89,324 cholecystectomy specimens sampled from 2003 to 2016 were 
      retrospectively evaluated. The numbers of adenocarcinomas, dysplasias, 
      intracholecystic neoplasms/adenomas, intestinal metaplasias and reactive atypia 
      were identified with the review of pathology reports and the regional and 
      countrywide incidence rates were presented in percentages. RESULTS: Epithelial 
      changes/lesions were reported in 6% of cholecystectomy materials. Of these 
      epithelial lesions, 7% were reported as adenocarcinoma, 0.9% as high-grade 
      dysplasia, 4% as low-grade dysplasia, 7.8% as reactive/regenerative atypia, 1.7% 
      as neoplastic polyp, and 15.6% as intestinal metaplasia. The remaining lesions 
      (63%) primarily included non-neoplastic polypoids/hyperplastic lesions and 
      antral/pyloric metaplasia. There were also differences between pathology 
      laboratories. CONCLUSION: The major causes of the difference in reporting these 
      epithelial changes/lesions and neoplasms include the differences related to the 
      institute's oncological surgery frequency, sampling protocols, geographical 
      dissimilarities, and differences in the diagnoses/interpretations of the 
      pathologists. It seems that the diagnosis may change if new sections are taken 
      from the specimen when any epithelial abnormality is seen during microscopic 
      examination of the cholecystectomy materials.

TI  - A FISH assay efficiently screens for BRAF gene rearrangements in pancreatic 
      acinar-type neoplasms.
PG  - 132-140
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2017.106 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 1-2% of pancreatic neoplasms are acinar cell carcinomas. Recently, 
      BRAF gene rearrangements were identified in over 20% of acinar-type neoplasms, 
      which included both pure acinar cell carcinomas and mixed carcinomas with acinar 
      differentiation, using next-generation sequencing-based platforms, providing a 
      potential therapeutic target for patients with these neoplasms. Thus, it is 
      clinically important to develop a rapid, cost- and material-efficient assay to 
      screen for BRAF gene fusions in pancreatic acinar-type neoplasms. We developed a 
      dual color, break-apart FISH assay to detect BRAF gene rearrangements in these 
      neoplasms and evaluated its performance in comparison to next-generation 
      sequencing-based studies. A blinded BRAF rearrangement FISH investigation was 
      performed on 31 acinar-type neoplasms that had been studied previously by 
      next-generation sequencing-based analysis as well as on 18 additional acinar-type 
      neoplasms that were accrued over the past 2 years. In total, BRAF fusions were 
      identified in 12/49 (24%) acinar-type neoplasms by FISH. BRAF fusion partners 
      were uncovered by using targeted next-generation sequencing studies in 11 
      FISH-positive cases that had sufficient material for next-generation sequencing 
      studies. SND1 was the most frequent fusion partner involved in BRAF-fusion 
      acinar-type neoplasms (50%), followed by HERPUD1 (18%). No BRAF fusions were 
      identified by next-generation sequencing in any of the FISH-negative cases 
      investigated. FISH analysis showed that BRAF rearrangements were diffusely 
      present across tumor-rich areas in BRAF-fusion acinar-type neoplasms, which is 
      consistent with an oncogenic driver alteration pattern. Thus, we demonstrated 
      that, in comparison to targeted next-generation sequencing-based technologies, 
      the FISH assay is highly sensitive and specific as well as time- and 
      cost-efficient in the detection of BRAF fusions in acinar-type neoplasms. The 
      FISH assay can be easily implemented in diagnostic settings to identify 
      acinar-type neoplasms patients potentially suitable for targeted therapy to 
      inhibit MAPK pathway activity.

TI  - Pancreatic intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm is genetically distinct from 
      intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and ductal adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1760-1772
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2017.60 [doi]
AB  - Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm is a relatively recently described member of 
      the pancreatic intraductal neoplasm family. The more common member of this 
      family, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, often carries genetic 
      alterations typical of pancreatic infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma (KRAS, TP53, 
      and CDKN2A) but additionally has mutations in GNAS and RNF43 genes. However, the 
      genetic characteristics of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm have not been 
      well characterized. Twenty-two intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms were 
      analyzed by either targeted next-generation sequencing, which enabled the 
      identification of sequence mutations, copy number alterations, and selected 
      structural rearrangements involving all targeted (≥300) genes, or whole-exome 
      sequencing. Three of these intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms were also 
      subjected to whole-genome sequencing. All intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms 
      revealed the characteristic histologic (cellular intraductal nodules of 
      back-to-back tubular glands lined by predominantly cuboidal cells with atypical 
      nuclei and no obvious intracellular mucin) and immunohistochemical (immunolabeled 
      with MUC1 and MUC6 but were negative for MUC2 and MUC5AC) features. By genomic 
      analyses, there was loss of CDKN2A in 5/20 (25%) of these cases. However, the 
      majority of the previously reported intraductal papillary mucinous 
      neoplasm-related alterations were absent. Moreover, in contrast to most ductal 
      neoplasms of the pancreas, MAP-kinase pathway was not involved. In fact, 2/22 
      (9%) of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms did not reveal any mutations in the 
      tested genes. However, certain chromatin remodeling genes (MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, 
      BAP1, PBRM1, EED, and ATRX) were found to be mutated in 7/22 (32%) of intraductal 
      tubulopapillary neoplasms and 27% harbored phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 
      pathway (PIK3CA, PIK3CB, INPP4A, and PTEN) mutations. In addition, 4/18 (18%) of 
      intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms had FGFR2 fusions (FGFR2-CEP55, 
      FGFR2-SASS6, DISP1-FGFR2, FGFR2-TXLNA, and FGFR2-VCL) and 1/18 (5.5%) had 
      STRN-ALK fusion. Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm is a distinct 
      clinicopathologic entity in the pancreas. Although its intraductal nature and 
      some clinicopathologic features resemble those of intraductal papillary mucinous 
      neoplasm, our results suggest that intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm has 
      distinguishing genetic characteristics. Some of these mutated genes are 
      potentially targetable. Future functional studies will be needed to determine the 
      consequences of these gene alterations.

TI  - Immunohistochemical Classification of Ampullary Carcinomas: Critical Reappraisal 
      Fails to Confirm Prognostic Relevance for Recently Proposed Panels, and 
      Highlights MUC5AC as a Strong Prognosticator.
PG  - 865-876
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000863 [doi]
AB  - Recently, immunohistochemistry-based classifications of ampullary carcinomas have 
      been proposed (Ang and colleagues [PMID: 24832159]; Chang and colleagues [PMID: 
      23439753]). In this study, the prognostic value of Ang/Chang panel markers (CK20, 
      MUC1, MUC2, CDX2) as well as other markers (CK7, MUC5AC, and MUC6) were tested on 
      full-faced sections of 136 ampullary carcinoma resections with substantial (>5 
      mm) invasion. Immunohistochemistry was correlated with both histologic 
      classification (intestinal [INT], pancreatobiliary [PB], or nontubular based on 
      ≥3/5 observer agreement) and clinical outcome. No prognostic correlation was 
      found with MUC1, CDX2, MUC2 or CK20 despite testing with different quantitative 
      cutoffs. CK7 and CK20 were nonspecific. Ang classification had reasonable 
      correlation with histologic subclassification of tubular cases as INT versus PB 
      with high specificity but low sensitivity and ambiguous category was large (29%) 
      and included also some classical cases. Prognostically, Ang classification 
      approached but did not reach statistical significance, even when their large 
      "ambiguous" group was eliminated and only tubular cases were analyzed (Ang-INT 
      vs. Ang-PB; P=0.08). The Chang panel, in which the definition of the INT 
      subcategory is not clearly defined, only marginally reached prognostic 
      significance when tested as MUC1+/CDX2- versus MUC1-/CDX2+ and only by Wilcoxon 
      test (P=0.0485) but 31% of the cases were "unclassifiable." The only individual 
      marker that was found to have direct and strong correlation with the clinical 
      outcome was MUC5AC (not used in the Ang or Chang panels), with statistically 
      significant survival differences found with various cutoffs tested (for 20% 
      cutoff, 5-y survival, 68% vs. 31%; P=0.0002). In addition, MUC5AC significantly 
      stratified the histologically PB and INT cases (P=0.01 and 0.03, respectively), 
      as well as Ang's ambiguous and Chang's unclassified cases (P=0.006 and 0.007, 
      respectively). In conclusion, the widely used putative lineage markers, 
      MUC1/MUC2/CK7/CK20/CDX2, do not seem to have direct/significant prognostic 
      correlation either individually or in combination of Ang and Chang panels. Ang 
      panel is helpful as an adjunct in determining the cell lineage with a few 
      caveats. MUC5AC proves to be a significant independent prognosticator and should 
      be incorporated into evaluation of ampullary carcinomas.

TI  - An Unusual Cause of Myelopathy: Ochronotic Spondyloarthropathy With Positive HLA 
      B27.
PG  - e206-e209
LID - 10.1097/PHM.0000000000000727 [doi]
AB  - Ochronosis is a late developing complication of alkaptonuria, a black brownish 
      pigment in the fibrous and cartilaginous tissues. Although most previous studies 
      reported alkaptonuria and back pain due to ochronosis, thoracic myelopathy is an 
      extremely rare complication. In this report, a paraparetic patient who has 
      ochronotic spondiloarthropathy with the presence of HLA B27 antigen is described. 
      He had low back and leg pain and morning stiffness for 5 yrs. Last year, these 
      were followed by tingling, numbness, and weakness the in lower extremities and he 
      was operated on with preliminary diagnosis of prolapsed disc herniation and cord 
      compression. Surgery is suggested for disc herniations related to ochronotic 
      spondyloarthropathy if it is necessary or neurologic symptoms are present. 
      However, his pain and weakness have partially recovered after the operation. 
      After medical and physical treatment, he showed clinically significant 
      improvements. This case report demonstrates that the management of ochronosis 
      needs a multidisciplinary approach with physiologic, neurologic, and psychologic 
      effects and proper treatment may significantly improve functional outcomes in 
      these patients.

PG  - 160-168

AB  - Professional medical conferences over the past five years have seen an enormous 
      increase in the use of Twitter in real-time, also known as "live-tweeting". At 
      the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) 2015 annual meeting, 
      24 attendees (the authors) volunteered to participate in a live-tweet group, the 
      #InSituPathologists. This group, along with other attendees, kept the world 
      updated via Twitter about the happenings at the annual meeting. There were 6,524 
      #USCAP2015 tweets made by 662 individual Twitter users; these generated 5,869,323 
      unique impressions (potential tweet-views) over a 13-day time span encompassing 
      the dates of the annual meeting. Herein we document the successful implementation 
      of the first official USCAP annual meeting live-tweet group, including the 
      pros/cons of live-tweeting and other experiences of the original 
      #InSituPathologists group members. No prior peer-reviewed publications to our 
      knowledge have described in depth the use of an organized group to "live-tweet" a 
      pathology meeting. We believe our group to be the first of its kind in the field 
      of pathology.

TI  - Thyroid FNAC containing hürthle cells and hürthle-like cells: A study of 128 
      cases.
PG  - 214-219
LID - 10.4103/0970-9371.190447 [doi]
AB  - AIM: It is a diagnostic challenge to differentiate benign and malignant cytology 
      in the presence of Hürthle cells. In our previous study, it was determined that 
      in fine needle aspirations (FNA), the malignancy outcome of the Hürthle cells 
      containing group tend to be papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in a higher 
      percentage. The most common misinterpretation is caused by PTC cells with large 
      cytoplasm-like Hürthle cells. The aim of this study is to predict histologic 
      outcome of the nodules, which have Hürthle cells in FNA according to cytological, 
      clinical features, and BRAF(V600E) mutation status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Detailed cytological features of 128 cases were compared with histopathological 
      diagnosis. The analysis of BRAF(V600E) mutation of the PTC cases were performed 
      by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The neoplastic outcome was 
      increased statistically significantly with younger age (P = 0.020), increase in 
      cellular dyshesion (P = 0.016), presence of nuclear budding (P = 0.046), and 
      granular chromatin (P = 0.003). Nuclear budding (P = 0.014), granular chromatin 
      (P = 0.012), and hypoechoic nodules in ultrasonography (P = 0.011) were 
      significant independent factors for the increase in the malignancy risk. 
      Increased lymphocytes (P= 0.015) and colloid were related to non-neoplastic 
      outcome. According to the surgical outcome, more than half of the malign cases 
      were PTC (74%). BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 27.8% of the PTC cases. 
      CONCLUSION: PTC cases containing Hürthle cell-like cells may lead to diagnostic 
      errors. Nuclear budding and granular chromatin of Hürthle cells are significant, 
      remarkable findings to predict the outcome of neoplasm and malignancy.

TI  - Intraductal Tubulopapillary Neoplasm of the Pancreas: A Clinicopathologic and 
      Immunohistochemical Analysis of 33 Cases.
PG  - 313-325
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000782 [doi]
AB  - Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) is a relatively recently described 
      member of the pancreatic intraductal neoplasm family. Thus, the literature on its 
      histologic and immunohistochemical features, clinical behavior, and its 
      similarities and differences from other pancreatic neoplasms is limited. 
      Thirty-three cases of ITPN, the largest series to date, were identified. 
      Immunohistochemical labeling for cytokeratins, glycoproteins, pancreatic enzymes, 
      markers for intestinal and neuroendocrine differentiation, and antibodies 
      associated with genetic alterations previously described in pancreatic neoplasms 
      was performed. Clinicopathologic features and survival was assessed. Seventeen 
      patients were female and 14 were male. Mean age was 55 years (range, 25 to 79 y). 
      Median overall tumor size was 4.5 cm (range, 0.5 to 15 cm). Forty-five percent of 
      the tumors occurred in the head, 32% in the body/tail, and 23% showed diffuse 
      involvement. Microscopically, the tumors were characterized by intraductal 
      nodules composed of tightly packed small tubular glands lined by cuboidal cells 
      lacking apparent mucin. Although it was often challenging to determine its 
      extent, invasion was present in 71%. Almost all tumors labeled for CAM5.2, CK7, 
      and CK19; most expressed CA19.9, MUC1, and MUC6. CDX2, MUC2, trypsin, 
      chymotrypsin, chromogranin, and synaptophysin were not expressed. SMAD4 
      expression was retained in 100%; p16 expression and p53 overexpression was seen 
      in 33% and 27%, respectively. Follow-up information was available for 22 patients 
      (median follow-up, 45 mo; range, 11 to 173 mo). Two patients with invasive 
      carcinoma died of disease at 23 and 41 months, respectively. One patient died of 
      unrelated causes at 49 months. Twelve patients were alive with disease. Seven 
      patients were alive with no evidence of disease. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
      survival rates were 100% in patients without an invasive component and 100%, 91%, 
      and 71%, respectively, in patients with an invasive component (P=0.7). ITPN is a 
      distinct clinicopathologic entity in the pancreas. Despite the difficulties of 
      determining the extent of invasive carcinoma in many cases, the overall outcome 
      seems to be relatively favorable and substantially better than that of 
      conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, even when only the cases with 
      invasive carcinoma are considered.

TI  - Distinct pathways of pathogenesis of intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms 
      and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.
PG  - 523-532
AB  - Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm (IOPN) of the pancreas is classified as 
      a variant of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the WHO 
      guidelines. However, the neoplastic cells of IOPNs are unique, with distinctive 
      architecture/oncocytic cytoplasm. Although molecular/immunohistochemical features 
      of other IPMN variants have been extensively studied, those of IOPNs have not 
      been well characterized. Expression profile of antibodies associated with genetic 
      alterations previously described for ductal adenocarcinomas (DAs) and IPMNs 
      (SMAD4/β-catenin/p53/mesothelin/claudin-4) as well as antibodies to mucins and 
      differentiation markers [MUC1/MUC2/MUC5AC/MUC6/CDX2/hepatocyte paraffin-1 
      (HepPar-1)] was investigated in 24 IOPNs and 22 IPMNs to assess the 
      similarities/differences between these tumors. Expression of mesothelin and 
      claudin-4 was dissimilar between these tumor types: A higher proportion of IOPNs 
      labeled with mesothelin [21/24 (87.5 %) of IOPNs, 6/22 (27 %) of IPMNs, 
      p < 0.001], while the reverse was true for claudin-4 [2/23 (9 %) of IOPNs, 9/22 
      (41 %) of IPMNs, p = 0.01]. The results of immunolabeling for SMAD4/β-catenin/p53 
      were similar in both: None of the cases showed SMAD4 loss in the intraductal 
      components, and only 1/21 (5 %) of IOPNs and 2/22 (9 %) of IPMNs revealed 
      abnormal β-catenin expression (p = 0.49). Nuclear p53 accumulation was seen 
      mostly in architecturally complex/high-grade dysplasia areas in both. 
      Immunolabeling for MUC proteins showed that almost all lesions expressed MUC5AC. 
      Twelve of the 24 (50 %) IOPNs and 6/22 (27 %) of IPMNs (p = 0.11) labeled for 
      MUC1, whereas 7/24 (29 %) of IOPNs and 10/22 (45 %) of IPMNs labeled for MUC2 
      (p = 0.25). MUC6 was expressed in 8/9 (89 %) of IOPNs (strong) and 6/21 (29 %) of 
      IPMNs (weak) (p = 0.002). Fourteen of the 23 (61 %) IOPNs and 4/22 (18 %) of 
      IPMNs labeled for HepPar-1 (p = 0.003). These results show that IOPNs have 
      distinct immunoprofile and provide support for the proposition that IOPN is a 
      distinct entity developing through a mechanism different from other pancreatic 
      ductal neoplasms.

TI  - Intrapancreatic distal common bile duct carcinoma: Analysis, staging 
      considerations, and comparison with pancreatic ductal and ampullary 
      adenocarcinomas.
PG  - 1358-1369
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2016.125 [doi]
AB  - Distal common bile duct carcinoma is a poorly characterized entity for reasons 
      such as variable terminology and difficulty in determining site of origin of 
      intrapancreatic lesions. We compared clinicopathologic features of 
      pancreatobiliary-type adenocarcinomas within the pancreas, but arising from the 
      distal common bile duct, with those of pancreatic and ampullary origin. Upon 
      careful review of 1017 pancreatoduodenectomy specimens with primary 
      adenocarcinoma, 52 (5%) qualified as intrapancreatic distal common bile duct 
      carcinoma. Five associated with an intraductal papillary neoplasm were excluded; 
      the remaining 47 were compared to 109 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and 133 
      ampullary carcinomas. Distal common bile duct carcinoma patients had a younger 
      median age (58 years) than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (65 years) 
      and ampullary carcinoma patients (68 years). Distal common bile duct carcinoma 
      was intermediate between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma 
      with regard to tumor size and rates of node metastases and margin positivity. 
      Median survival was better than for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (P=0.0010) 
      but worse than for ampullary carcinoma (P=0.0006). Distal common bile duct 
      carcinoma often formed an even band around the common bile duct and commonly 
      showed intraglandular neutrophil-rich debris and a small tubular pattern. Poor 
      prognostic indicators included node metastasis (P=0.0010), lymphovascular 
      invasion (P=0.0299), and margin positivity (P=0.0069). Categorizing the tumors 
      based on size also had prognostic relevance (P=0.0096), unlike categorization 
      based on anatomic structures invaded. Primary distal common bile duct carcinoma 
      is seen in younger patients than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or ampullary 
      carcinoma. Its prognosis is significantly better than pancreatic ductal 
      adenocarcinoma and worse than ampullary carcinoma, at least partly because of 
      differences in clinical presentation. Use of size-based criteria for staging 
      appears to improve its prognostic relevance. Invasive pancreatobiliary-type 
      distal common bile duct carcinomas are uncommon in the West and have substantial 
      clinicopathologic differences from carcinomas arising from the pancreas and 
      ampulla.

TI  - Skin punch biopsy sectioning: before or after tissue processing?
PG  - 984-988
LID - 10.1111/cup.12790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We intended to study whether there is a meaningful difference in 
      microscopic examination between dividing a biopsy section into two equal parts 
      before tissue processing (first method) or after (second method). METHODS: A 
      total of 400 cases were included in the study. Punch biopsies (PB) were cut into 
      two pieces using the first method in 200 cases and just before paraffin embedding 
      in another 200 cases using the second method. We microscopically evaluated the 
      epidermal mesh view, the presence of a cross-cut hair follicle and bow shape 
      because of epidermal angling, the presence of two pieces on the slide and if 
      there was a difference of >2 mm between the parts, and the number of new sections 
      and new slides. RESULTS: Cross-cut hair follicle (p = 0.018), epidermal mesh view 
      (p = 0.036), difference of >2 mm between the parts (p = 0.008), the number of new 
      sections (p < 0.001) and new slides (p < 0.001) were considerably higher when the 
      first method was used compared with the second method. The presence of two pieces 
      was less (p < 0.001) when using the first method. CONCLUSIONS: We noted a 
      meaningful difference in the quality of microscopic evaluation between the first 
      and second methods. Better sections were obtained with the second method. In 
      addition, the decrease in the number of new slides will reduce workload, archival 
      work and cost.

TI  - Non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas: clinicopathologic analysis of 47 cases and 
      comparison with ampullary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas.
PG  - 255-266
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2016.174 [doi]
AB  - Literature on non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas is limited. We analyzed 47 
      resected non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas. Histologically, 78% were tubular-type 
      adenocarcinomas mostly gastro-pancreatobiliary type and only 19% pure intestinal. 
      Immunohistochemistry (n=38) revealed commonness of 'gastro-pancreatobiliary 
      markers' (CK7 55, MUC1 50, MUC5AC 50, and MUC6 34%), whereas 'intestinal markers' 
      were relatively less common (MUC2 36, CK20 42, and CDX2 44%). Squamous and 
      mucinous differentiation were rare (in five each); previously, unrecognized 
      adenocarcinoma patterns were noted (three microcystic/vacuolated, two cribriform, 
      one of comedo-like, oncocytic papillary, and goblet-cell-carcinoid-like). An 
      adenoma component common in ampullary-duodenal cancers was noted in only about a 
      third. Most had plaque-like or ulcerating growth. Mismatch repair protein 
      alterations were detected in 13% (all with plaque-like growth and pushing-border 
      infiltration). When compared with ampullary (n=355) and pancreatic ductal (n=227) 
      carcinomas, non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas had intermediary pathologic 
      features with mean invasive size of 2.9 cm (vs 1.9, and 3.3) and 59% nodal 
      metastasis (vs 45, and 77%). Its survival (3-, 5-year rates of 57 and 57%) was 
      similar to that of ampullary-duodenal carcinomas (59 and 52%; P=0.78), but was 
      significantly better than the ampullary ductal (41 and 29%, P<0.001) and 
      pancreatic (28 and 18%, P<0.001) carcinomas. In conclusion, 
      non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas are more histologically heterogeneous than 
      previously appreciated. Their morphologic versatility (commonly showing 
      gastro-pancreatobiliary lineage and hitherto unrecognized patterns), frequent 
      plaque-like growth minus an adenoma component, and frequent expression of 
      gastro-pancreatobiliary markers suggest that many non-ampullary-duodenal 
      carcinomas may arise from Brunner glands or gastric metaplasia or heterotopic 
      pancreatobiliary epithelium. The clinical behavior of non-ampullary-duodenal 
      carcinoma is closer to that of ampullary-duodenal subset of ampullary carcinomas, 
      but is significantly better than that of ampullary ductal and pancreatic cancers. 
      The frequency of mismatch repair protein alterations suggest that routine testing 
      should be considered, especially in the non-ampullary-duodenal carcinomas with 
      plaque-like growth and pushing-border infiltration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adrenal haemorrhage is a relatively rare condition. If there is not 
      a specific ethology describing adrenal hematoma, then, this is termed as 
      'idiopathic adrenal hematoma'. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We presented a case of 
      idiopathic adrenal hematoma in this study. A 62-year-old woman was referred to 
      our hospital for evaluation of a 40mm mass in the left upper abdominal cavity. 
      The histopathological findings of the surgical specimen revealed a hematoma with 
      normal adrenal tissue. DISCUSSION: The incidence of adrenal haemorrhage was found 
      to be 1.1% regarding autopsy results. The Adrenal gland is highly vascular and 
      vulnerable to haemorrhage. Before a surgical operation, it is difficult to 
      diagnose idiopathic adrenal hematomas. CONCLUSION: An adrenal hematoma should be 
      kept in mind when adrenal masses assessing.

TI  - Ampullary carcinoma is often of mixed or hybrid histologic type: an analysis of 
      reproducibility and clinical relevance of classification as pancreatobiliary 
      versus intestinal in 232 cases.
PG  - 1575-1585
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2016.124 [doi]
AB  - Histologic classification of ampullary carcinomas as intestinal versus 
      pancreatobiliary is rapidly becoming a part of management algorithms, with 
      immunohistochemical classification schemes also being devised using this 
      classification scheme as their basis. However, data on the reproducibility and 
      prognostic relevance of this classification system are limited. In this study, 
      five observers independently evaluated 232 resected ampullary carcinomas with 
      invasive component >3 mm. Overall interobserver agreement was 'fair' (κ 0.39; 
      P<0.001) with complete agreement in 23%. Using agreement by 3/5 observers as 
      'consensus' 40% of cases were classified as 'mixed' pancreatobiliary and 
      intestinal. When observers were asked to provide a final diagnosis based on the 
      predominant pattern in cases initially classified as mixed, there was 'moderate' 
      agreement (κ 0.44; P<0.0001) with 5/5 agreeing in 35%. Cases classified as 
      pancreatobiliary by consensus (including those with pure-pancreatobiliary or 
      mixed-predominantly pancreatobiliary features) had shorter overall (median 41 
      months) and 5-year survival (38%) than those classified as 
      pure-intestinal/mixed-predominantly intestinal (80 months and 57%, respectively; 
      P=0.026); however, on multivariate analysis this was not independent of 
      established prognostic parameters. Interestingly, when compared with 476 cases of 
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, the pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinomas 
      had better survival (16 versus 41 months, P<0.001), even when matched by size and 
      node status. In conclusion, presumably because of the various cell types 
      comprising the region, ampullary carcinomas frequently show mixed phenotypes and 
      intratumoral heterogeneity, which should be considered when devising management 
      protocols. Caution is especially warranted when applying this histologic 
      classification to biopsies and tissue microarrays. While ampullary carcinomas 
      with more pancreatobiliary morphology have a worse prognosis than intestinal ones 
      this does not appear to be an independent prognostic factor. However, 
      pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinomas have a much better prognosis than 
      their pancreatic counterparts.

TI  - Adenocarcinoma ex-goblet cell carcinoid (appendiceal-type crypt cell 
      adenocarcinoma) is a morphologically distinct entity with highly aggressive 
      behavior and frequent association with peritoneal/intra-abdominal dissemination: 
      an analysis of 77 cases.
PG  - 1243-53
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2016.105 [doi]
AB  - High-grade versions of appendiceal goblet cell carcinoids ('adenocarcinoma 
      ex-goblet cell carcinoids') are poorly characterized. We herein document 77 
      examples. Tumors occurred predominantly in females (74%), mean age 55 years 
      (29-84), most with disseminated abdominal (77% peritoneal, 58% gynecologic tract 
      involvement) and stage IV (65%) disease. Many presented to gynecologic 
      oncologists, and nine had a working diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma. Metastases to 
      liver (n=3) and lung (n=1) were uncommon and none arose in adenomatous lesions. 
      Tumors had various histologic patterns, in variable combinations, most of which 
      were fairly specific, making them recognizable as appendiceal in origin, even at 
      metastatic sites: I: Ordinary goblet cell carcinoid/crypt pattern (rounded, 
      non-luminal acini with well-oriented goblet cells), in variable amounts in all 
      cases. II: Poorly cohesive goblet cell pattern (diffusely infiltrative 
      cords/single files of signet ring-like/goblet cells). III: Poorly cohesive 
      non-mucinous cell (diffuse-infiltrative growth of non-mucinous cells). IV: 
      Microglandular (rosette-like glandular) pattern without goblet cells. V: Mixed 
      'other' carcinoma foci (including ordinary intestinal/mucinous). VI: goblet cell 
      carcinoid pattern with high-grade morphology (marked nuclear atypia). VII: Solid 
      sheet-like pattern punctuated by goblet cells/microglandular units. Ordinary 
      nested/trabecular ('carcinoid pattern') was very uncommon. In total, 33(52%) died 
      of disease, with median overall survival 38 months and 5-year survival 32%. On 
      multivariate analysis perineural invasion and younger age (<55) were 
      independently associated with worse outcome while lymph-vascular invasion, stage, 
      and nodal status trended toward, but failed to reach, statistical significance. 
      Worse behavior in younger patients combined with female predilection and 
      ovarian-affinity raise the possibility of hormone-assisted tumor progression. In 
      conclusion, 'adenocarcinoma ex-goblet cell carcinoid' is an appendix-specific, 
      high-grade malignant neoplasm with distinctive morphology that is recognizable at 
      metastatic sites and recapitulates crypt cells (appendiceal crypt cell 
      adenocarcinoma). Unlike intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, it occurs predominantly 
      in women, is disguised as gynecologic malignancy, and spreads along peritoneal 
      surfaces with only rare hematogenous metastasis. It appears to be significantly 
      more aggressive than appendiceal mucinous neoplasms.

TI  - Repeated Supramaximal Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress: Effect of β-Alanine Plus 
      Creatine Supplementation.
PG  - e26843
LID - 10.5812/asjsm.26843 [doi]
LID - e26843
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carnosine is a dipeptide formed from the β-alanine and histidine 
      amino acids and found in mainly in the brain and muscle, especially fast twitch 
      muscle. Carnosine and creatine has an antioxidant effect and carnosine accounts 
      for about 10% of the muscle's ability to buffer the H(+) ions produced by 
      exercise. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of beta 
      alanine and/or creatine supplementation on oxidant and antioxidant status during 
      repeated Wingate tests (WTs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty four sedentary males 
      participated in the study. Participants performed three 30s WTs with 2 minutes 
      rest between exercise bouts. After the first exercise session, the subjects were 
      assigned to one of four groups: Placebo, Creatine, Beta-alanine and Beta-alanine 
      plus creatine. Participants ingested twice per day for 22 consecutive days, then 
      four times per day for the following 6 days. After the supplementation period the 
      second exercise session was applied. Blood samples were taken before and 
      immediately after the each exercise session for the analysis of oxidative stress 
      and antioxidant markers. RESULTS: Malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase 
      activities were affected by neither supplementation nor exercise. During the 
      pre-supplementation session, protein carbonyl reduced and oxidized glutathione 
      (GSH and GSSG) levels increased immediately after the exercise. However, during 
      the post-supplementation session GSH and GSSG levels increased in beta-alanine 
      and beta-alanine plus creatine groups immediately after the exercise compared to 
      pre-exercise. In addition, during the post-supplementation session total 
      antioxidant capacity increased in beta-alanine group immediately after the 
      exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-alanine supplementation has limited antioxidant 
      effect during the repeated WTs.

TI  - The correlation of sodium iodide symporter and BRAF(V600E) mutation in classical

AB  - BRAF(V600E) mutation was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 96 
      consecutive cases with classical variant papillary thyroid cancer, and 
      immunohistochemical staining of Na+/I- symporter (NIS) protein was evaluated. 
      Localization (intracellular or membranous), density, and the intensity of 
      cytoplasmic staining were characterized semiquantitatively. Extrathyroidal 
      invasion, surgical margin positivity, and lymph node metastasis were compared 
      with BRAF(V600E) mutation and NIS expression. Eighty-eight patients who had at 
      least 24-month follow-up were also included in survival analysis. BRAF(V600E) 
      mutation was determined in 78.1% (75/96) and functional NIS activity in 74% 
      (71/96) of the cases. There were statistically significant differences in mean 
      ages between BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive (48.6) and BRAF(V600E) 
      mutation-negative cases (37.3; Levene test, P=.419; Student t test, P=.001). The 
      surgical margin positivity (46.7%) and extrathyroidal extension percentage 
      (54.7%) in the BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive group were higher than the negative 
      (28.6% and 33.3%, respectively) group, without statistical significance (P=.138 
      and P=.084, respectively). Functional NIS activity was higher in BRAF(V600E) 
      mutation-positive cases (78.1%) than mutation-negative ones (57.1%; P=.047). The 
      possibility of moderate and intense cytoplasmic staining in BRAF(V600E) 
      mutation-positive cases (72%) was 6.3 times higher than the possibility of weak 
      staining (28%) in the mutation-positive cases (95% confidence interval, 2.2-18.8; 
      P=.001). Functional NIS expression is higher in patients with classical variant 
      papillary thyroid cancer with BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, the clinical 
      features were not found to be associated with NIS expression. There may be 
      different mechanisms determining the outcome of therapy.

TI  - Comparison of Clinicopathologic Parameters and Survivals Between Epstein-Barr 
      Virus-positive and Her2-positive Gastric Cancers.
PG  - 609-614
LID - 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000353 [doi]
AB  - Gastric carcinomas are highly mortal neoplasms for which new therapeutic options 
      are being searched. The molecular subtyping of gastric adenocarcinomas was 
      proposed recently, and the relationship between etiopathogenetic types is still 
      under investigation. Here we compared histopathologic, prognostic, and survival 
      differences between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and Her2-positive gastric 
      adenocarcinomas. In a retrospective design, we searched the EBV status with 
      Epstein Barr Virus encoded small RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization, and the Her2 
      status both by immunohistochemistry and by chromogenic in situ hybridization of 
      106 gastrectomized gastric carcinomas. Histologic and clinical prognostic 
      parameters and survival information were determined, and retrieved from archival 
      tissues and clinical notes. The Her2 positivity rate was 12.3% and the EBV 
      positivity rate was 7.6%. Among EBER-positive cases, Her2 positivity was not 
      detected. Her2 positivity was detected more in intestinal differentiated tumors, 
      whereas EBER positivity was detected in undifferentiated tumors (P=0.003). There 
      was no correlation of Her2 or EBER positivity with the tumor stage. Median 
      survivals of EBER-positive, Her2-positive, and both negative cases were 11.5, 18, 
      and 20.5 months, respectively. The tumor stage and distant metastasis were found 
      to be significant for survival in the multivariate analysis. In our 106 
      gastrectomized gastric carcinoma cases, EBV-positive and Her2-positive groups 
      were found to be unrelated as proposed in the upcoming classification of gastric 
      carcinomas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies have failed to identify any prognostic value of the 
      current T-stage protocol for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by the 
      American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union for International Cancer Control 
      unless some grouping was performed. METHODS: To document the parameters included 
      in this T-stage protocol, 223 consecutive pancreatoduodenectomy specimens with 
      PDAC were processed by a uniform grossing protocol. RESULTS: Peripancreatic soft 
      tissue (PST) involvement, the main pT3 parameter, was found to be inapplicable 
      and irreproducible due to lack of a true capsule in the pancreas and variability 
      in the amount and distribution of adipose tissue. Furthermore, 91 % of the cases 
      showed carcinoma in the adipose tissue, presumably representing the PST, and thus 
      were classified as pT3. An additional 4.5 % were qualified as pT3 due to 
      extension into adjacent sites. The T-stage defined as such was not found to have 
      any correlation with survival (p = 0.4). A revised T-stage protocol was devised 
      that defined pT1 as 2 cm or smaller, pT2 as >2-4 cm, and pT3 as larger than 4 cm. 
      This revised protocol was tested in 757 consecutive PDACs. The median and 3-year 
      survival rates of this size-based protocol were 26, 18, 13 months, and 40 %, 
      26 %, 20 %, respectively (p < 0.0001). The association between higher T-stage and 
      shorter survival persisted in N0 cases and in multivariate modeling. Analysis of 
      the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database also confirmed the 
      survival differences (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that resected 
      PDACs are already spread to various surfaces of the pancreas, leaving only about 
      4 % of PDACs to truly qualify as pT1/T2, and that the current T-stage protocol 
      does not have any prognostic correlation. In contrast, as shown previously in 
      many studies, size is an important prognosticator, and a size-based T-stage 
      protocol is more applicable and has prognostic value in PDAC.

AB  - We tested and clinically validated a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      mutation panel using 80 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. 
      Forty non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), 30 melanoma, and 30 gastrointestinal 
      (12 colonic, 10 gastric, and 8 pancreatic adenocarcinoma) FFPE samples were 
      selected from laboratory archives. After appropriate specimen and nucleic acid 
      quality control, 80 NGS libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSight tumor 
      (TST) kit and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequence alignment, variant 
      calling, and sequencing quality control were performed using vendor software and 
      laboratory-developed analysis workflows. TST generated ≥500× coverage for 98.4% 
      of the 13,952 targeted bases. Reproducible and accurate variant calling was 
      achieved at ≥5% variant allele frequency with 8 to 12 multiplexed samples per 
      MiSeq flow cell. TST detected 112 variants overall, and confirmed all known 
      single-nucleotide variants (n = 27), deletions (n = 5), insertions (n = 3), and 
      multinucleotide variants (n = 3). TST detected at least one variant in 85.0% 
      (68/80), and two or more variants in 36.2% (29/80), of samples. TP53 was the most 
      frequently mutated gene in NSCLC (13 variants; 13/32 samples), gastrointestinal 
      malignancies (15 variants; 13/25 samples), and overall (30 variants; 28/80 
      samples). BRAF mutations were most common in melanoma (nine variants; 9/23 
      samples). Clinically relevant NGS data can be obtained from routine clinical FFPE 
      solid tumor specimens using TST, benchtop instruments, and vendor-supplied 
      bioinformatics pipelines.

TI  - Substaging of Lymph Node Status in Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Has 
      Strong Prognostic Correlations: Proposal for a Revised N Classification for TNM 
      Staging.
PG  - S1187-95
LID - 10.1245/s10434-015-4861-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current tumor-node-metastasis staging system for the pancreas 
      does not incorporate the number of lymph nodes (LNs) with metastasis. METHODS: 
      Among 1649 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 227 stringently defined pancreatic ductal 
      adenocarcinomas (PDACs) that had undergone a specific approach of LN harvesting 
      were analyzed for the prognostic value of LN substaging protocols used for other 
      gastrointestinal (GI) organs. RESULTS: The median number of LNs harvested was 18, 
      and the median number of LNs with metastasis was 3. Lymph node metastasis was 
      detected in 175 cases (77 %). The number of LNs involved correlated significantly 
      with clinical outcome. When cases were substaged with the protocol already in use 
      for the upper GI organs (N0: no metastasis, N1: metastasis to 1-2 LNs; N2: 
      metastasis to ≥3 LNs), the median overall survival times were 35, 21, and 18 
      months, and the respective 3-year survival rates were 46, 34, and 20 % (p = 
      0.004). Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 
      database also confirmed the survival differences between these substages (median 
      overall survival times of 23, 15, and 14 months and respective 3-year survival 
      rates of 37, 22, and 18 %; p < 0.0001). The substaging protocol for the lower GI 
      organs (N0: no metastasis; N1: metastasis to 1-3 LNs; N2: metastasis to ≥4 LNs) 
      also was significant, with median overall survival times of 35, 21, 18 months and 
      respective 3-year survival rates of 46, 26, and 23 %; p = 0.009). The association 
      between higher N stage and shorter survival persisted with multivariate modeling 
      for both protocols, although the prognostic value of the upper GI protocol 
      appeared to be slightly stronger according to the Akaike Information Criterion 
      method. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, with proper LN harvesting, the LN metastasis 
      rate in PDACs is very high (77 %). Substaging of LN metastasis has significant 
      prognostic value and needs to be considered in the N staging of PDACs. The 
      protocol already in use for other upper GI tract organs, which currently also is 
      proven significant for ampulla, would be preferable, although the lower GI tract 
      protocol also is applicable.

TI  - Increased mean platelet volume is related to histologic severity of primary 
      biliary cirrhosis.
PG  - 1382-5
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000463 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the main platelet volume (MPV) as a severity marker in patients 
      with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients 
      with biopsy-proven and as yet untreated PBC followed between January 2008 and 
      January 2015 were included in this study. Liver biopsies were categorized as 
      early stage (stage 1 and 2 according to Scheuer's histological stage) and late 
      stage (Scheuer's stage 3 and 4). As part of the routine evaluation, all PBC 
      patients had their full blood count and biochemistry profile determined, where 
      MPV, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, red cell distribution 
      width (RDW), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma 
      glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin values were 
      evaluated. Both groups were compared in terms of the RDW/platelet ratio, the AST 
      platelet ratio index, and the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio. RESULTS: Eighteen 
      patients had early-stage disease (46.2%), whereas 21 PBC patients had late-stage 
      disease (53.8%). There were no differences between groups in terms of routine 
      hematological parameters (white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin, 
      RDW) or biochemical parameters (alanine aminotransferase, AST, gamma glutamyl 
      transferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin) (P>0.05). Similarly, 
      there were no differences in AST platelet ratio index, RDW/platelet ratio, or 
      neutrophil lymphocyte ratio values between groups (P values 0.08, 0.19, and 0.14, 
      respectively). The MPV and direct bilirubin were significantly higher in the 
      advanced stage group compared with the early-stage group (11.08 vs. 9.73 fl, 
      respectively, P=0.01 and 0.44 vs. 0.28 mg/dl, respectively, P=0.03). The area 
      under the curve, cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity of MPV and direct 
      bilirubin for detecting advanced stage were 0.721, 10.3, 71%, and 66%, 
      respectively, and 0.698, 0.23, 71%, and 66%, respectively. CONCLUSION: MPV can be 
      used as a noninvasive, simple, and effective parameter in patients with PBC to 
      predict histological severity of the disease.

TI  - The role of collecting bladder wash fluid before biopsy procedure to help the 
      cytological diagnosis of residual tumor.
PG  - 85-9
LID - 10.4103/0970-9371.160549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary cytology has low sensitivity and specificity in urinary 
      neoplasm. AIM: We planned to assess whether the examination of bladder washing 
      before biopsy (WBB) plays a role in better cytologic diagnosis of bladder wash 
      fluid collected after biopsy procedure (WAB) in papillary urothelial neoplasms. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 36 patients with papillary lesion of bladder. 
      Prior to the biopsy, the bladder is washed and fluid is collected for cytology; 
      later transurethral resection (TUR) is performed, then bladders are washed again 
      and the fluid is separately collected for cytology. Both fluids were centrifuged 
      and stained with May-Grünwald Giemsa (MGG). First the WAB slides were evaluated 
      and diagnosed. After evaluation of the WBB slides, the WAB slides were 
      rediagnosed. Presence of cellularity, papillary structure, fusiform cells, 
      background bleeding, and cytolysis in WBB and WAB were evaluated separately. 
      RESULTS: We determined that 31 WBB samples were hypercellular, and 12 of them 
      remained as hypercellular in WAB. Papillary structures were observed in 20 WBB 
      samples; and in one WAB cytology. In 29 cases where no fusiform cells are 
      identified in WBB, 22 showed fusiform cells in WAB. Cytolysis in WABs was noted 
      in 15 cases whose WBBs did not show cytolysis. The decrease in cellularity, 
      papillary structure (P < 0.001, both), cytolysis (P = 0.008), and fusiform cells 
      (P < 0.001) were statistically significant. After seeing the WBB slides, we 
      reevaluated the WAB slides. Out of the eight out of 36 (22.2%) samples diagnosed 
      with degeneration previously, five (62.5%) samples were rediagnosed as benign, 
      two (25%) as cytologic atypia which favor reactive, and one (12.5%) as malignant. 
      CONCLUSION: Due to the better quality, initial evaluation of WBB may help more 
      effective diagnoses of WAB slides.

TI  - Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms of the bile ducts: clinicopathologic, 
      immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis of 20 cases.
PG  - 1249-64
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2015.61 [doi]
AB  - Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm is a well-established entity in the 
      pancreas. A similar, if not identical, tumor occurs also in the biliary tract. We 
      conducted a multicenter study of 20 such lesions, focusing on their 
      clinicopathologic characteristics and molecular profile. Biliary intraductal 
      tubulopapillary neoplasms were seen in patients in their 60s (mean 62 years). The 
      tumors were intrahepatic 70%, extrahepatic 10%, and perihilar 20%; mean tumor 
      size was 6.9 cm. Histologically, all intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms 
      showed, in addition to their typical tubular pattern, solid areas (70%) or 
      abortive papillae (50%). Necrosis was common (85%), predominantly focal (40%), 
      and with 'comedocarcinoma-like pattern' in 40%. Immunohistochemically, these 
      neoplasms were characterized by the expression of MUC1 (80%) and MUC6 (30%) and 
      by the absence of MUC2 and MUC5AC. Associated invasive carcinomas were present in 
      16 (80%), mainly conventional tubular adenocarcinoma (50%). The molecular 
      alterations observed included CDKN2A/p16 (intraductal components 44%, invasive 
      33%) and TP53 (intraductal components 17%, invasive 9%). Mutations in KRAS 
      (intraductal 6%, invasive 0%), PIK3CA (intraductal 6%, invasive 0%), and loss of 
      SMAD4/DPC4 (intraductal 7%, invasive 0%) were rare. No alterations/mutations were 
      identified in IDH1/2, BRAF, GNAS, EGFR, HER2, and β-catenin. Follow-up 
      information was available for 17 patients (85%) with mean follow-up 44 months. 
      Overall combined survival rates showed favorable prognosis: 1 year 100%, 3 years 
      90%, and 5 years 90%. In conclusion, despite the relatively high incidence of 
      invasive carcinoma (80%), available follow-up suggests that biliary intraductal 
      tubulopapillary neoplasms have an indolent behavior. Molecular analyses highlight 
      the low prevalence of alterations of common oncogenic signaling pathways in 
      intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. Further studies using whole-exome 
      sequencing are required to discover yet unknown molecular changes and to 
      understand the carcinogenesis of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms.

TI  - Substaging Nodal Status in Ampullary Carcinomas has Significant Prognostic Value: 
      Proposed Revised Staging Based on an Analysis of 313 Well-Characterized Cases.
PG  - 4392-401
LID - 10.1245/s10434-015-4499-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current nodal staging (N-staging) of ampullary carcinoma in the TNM 
      staging system distinguishes between node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N1) 
      disease but does not consider the metastatic lymph node (LN) number. METHODS: 
      Overall, 313 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for ampullary 
      adenocarcinoma were categorized as N0, N1 (1-2 metastatic LNs), or N2 (≥3 
      metastatic LNs), as proposed by Kang et al. Clinicopathological features and 
      overall survival (OS) of the three groups were compared. RESULTS: The median 
      number of LNs examined was 11, and LN metastasis was present in 142 cases (45 %). 
      When LN-positive cases were re-classified according to the proposed staging 
      system, 82 were N1 (26 %) and 60 were N2 (19 %). There was a significant 
      correlation between proposed N-stage and lymphovascular invasion, perineural 
      invasion, increased tumor size (each p < 0.001), and surgical margin positivity 
      (p = 0.001). The median OS in LN-negative cases was significantly longer than 
      that in LN-positive cases (107.5 vs. 32 months; p < 0.001). Patients with N1 and 
      N2 disease had median survivals of 40 and 24.5 months, respectively (p < 0.0001). 
      In addition, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals were 88, 76, 62 %, respectively, for 
      N0; 90, 55, 31.5 %, respectively, for N1; and 68, 34, 30 %, respectively for N2 
      (p < 0.001). Even with multivariate modeling, the association between higher 
      proposed N stage and shorter survival persisted (hazard ratio 1.6 for N1 and 1.9 
      for N2; p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Classification of nodal status in ampullary 
      carcinomas based on the number of metastatic LNs has a significant prognostic 
      value. A revised N-staging classification system should be incorporated into the 
      TNM staging of ampullary cancers.

TI  - The high-grade (WHO G3) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor category is 
      morphologically and biologically heterogenous and includes both well 
      differentiated and poorly differentiated neoplasms.
PG  - 683-90
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000408 [doi]
AB  - The 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification recommends that 
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) be graded on the basis of the mitotic 
      rate and Ki67 index, with grade 2 (G2) PanNETs defined as having a mitotic rate 
      of 2 to 20 mitotic figures/10 high-power fields or a Ki67 index of 3% to 20%. 
      Grade 3 (G3) pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is defined as having >20 
      mitotic figures/10 high-power fields or a Ki67 index of >20%. However, some 
      PanNETs show discordance between the mitotic rate and Ki67 index, usually having 
      a Ki67 index in the G3 range but a mitotic rate suggesting G2, prompting us to 
      examine the clinical significance of the Ki67 index in a large series of 
      clinically well-characterized mitotic G2 PanNETs. Mitotic G2 well differentiated 
      PanNETs, surgically resected at our institutions were reviewed. Of those, 19 
      cases had a Ki67>20% and were selected as the study group of grade-discordant 
      (mitotic count G2/Ki67 index G3) PanNETs. For comparison, 53 grade-concordant 
      (both mitotic count and Ki67 index G2) PanNETs matched for presenting stage with 
      the discordant group as well as 43 morphologically poorly differentiated (either 
      small cell or large cell type) pancreatic NECs were also included. The percentage 
      of Ki67-positive neoplastic cells was quantified by manual counting of at least 
      500 cells on printed photographic images of "hot spots." The mean Ki67 index for 
      grade-concordant and grade-discordant PanNETs and poorly differentiated NECs were 
      8.1% (range, 3% to 20%), 40% (range, 24% to 80%), and 70% (range, 40% to 98%), 
      respectively. Overall, patients with grade-discordant PanNETs had significantly 
      longer survival time compared with the patients with poorly differentiated NEC 
      (median survival of 54.1 vs. 11 mo and 5 y survival of 29.1% vs. 16.1%; P=0.002). 
      In addition, the survival time of the patients with grade-discordant PanNETs was 
      shorter than that of the patients with grade-concordant PanNETs (median survival 
      of 67.8 mo and 5 y survival of 62.4%); however, the difference was not 
      statistically significant (P=0.2). Our data support the notion that the mitotic 
      rate and Ki67 index-based grades of PanNETs can be discordant, and when the Ki67 
      index indicates G3, the clinical outcome is slightly worse. More importantly, we 
      demonstrate that well differentiated PanNETs that are G3 by Ki67 are 
      significantly less aggressive than bona fide poorly differentiated NECs, 
      suggesting that the current WHO G3 category is heterogenous, contains 2 distinct 
      neoplasms, and can be further separated into well differentiated PanNET with an 
      elevated proliferation rate and poorly differentiated NEC.

TI  - High nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha expression is a predictor of 
      distant recurrence in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) expression as a 
      prognostic factor for distant recurrence (DR) and local recurrence (LR) after 
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma resection. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tissue specimens were 
      collected from 98 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent resection 
      without neoadjuvant therapy between January 2000 and December 2011. Local 
      recurrence was defined as radiographic or pathologic evidence of progressive 
      disease in the pancreas, pancreatic bed, or associated nodal regions. Distant 
      recurrence was defined as radiographically or pathologically confirmed recurrent 
      disease in other sites. Immunohistochemical staining was performed and scored by 
      an independent pathologist blinded to patient outcomes. High HIF-1α overall 
      expression score was defined as high percentage and intensity staining and thus 
      score >1.33. Univariate analysis was performed for HIF-1α score with LR alone and 
      with DR. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of LR 
      and DR. RESULTS: Median follow-up time for all patients was 16.3 months. Eight 
      patients (8%) demonstrated isolated LR, 26 patients (26.5%) had isolated DR, and 
      13 patients had both LR and DR. Fifty-three patients (54%) had high HIF-1α 
      expression, and 45 patients (46%) had low HIF-1α expression. High HIF-1α 
      expression was significantly associated with DR (P=.03), and low HIF-1α 
      expression was significantly associated with isolated LR (P=.03). On multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis, high HIF-1α was the only significant predictor of 
      DR (odds ratio 2.46 [95% confidence interval 1.06-5.72]; P=.03). In patients with 
      a known recurrence, an HIF-1α score ≥2.5 demonstrated a specificity of 100% for 
      DR. CONCLUSIONS: High HIF-1α expression is a significant predictor of distant 
      failure versus isolated local failure in patients undergoing resection of 
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Expression of HIF-1α may have utility in determining 
      candidates for adjuvant local radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy.

AB  - We herein summarize the pathology and most recent advances in the molecular 
      genetics of serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. They typically present as 
      relatively large, well-demarcated tumors (mean size, 6cm), predominantly 
      occurring in females. Pre-operative diagnosis remains challenging; imaging 
      findings and cyst fluid analysis often prove non-specific and fine-needle 
      aspiration often does not yield diagnostic cells. Pathologically, they are 
      characterized by a distinctive cytology referred to as "serous." Although they 
      have ductal differentiation, they distinctly lack the mucin production that 
      characterizes most other pancreatic ductal tumors, including ductal 
      adenocarcinoma and its variants, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) 
      and mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). They instead produce abundant glycogen 
      (glycogen-rich adenoma). Serous cystadenomas also lack the molecular alterations 
      that characterize ductal neoplasms, such as mutation of KRAS (high prevalence in 
      most mucinous ductal neoplasms), inactivation of SMAD4 (seen in ductal 
      adenocarcinomas), and mutations in GNAS (seen in some IPMNs) and RNF43 (detected 
      in MCNs and IPMNs). Instead, new molecular and immunohistochemical observations 
      place serous pancreatic tumors closer to "clear cell neoplasms" seen in various 
      other organs that are associated with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) pathway, such 
      as clear cell renal cell carcinomas and capillary hemangioblastomas. Patients 
      with VHL syndrome have an increased risk of developing serous pancreatic tumors 
      and somatic mutations of the VHL gene are common in these tumors along with 
      modification of its downstream effectors including hypoxia-inducible factor 
      (HIF1), glucose uptake and transporter-1 (GLUT-1), a common factor in clear cell 
      (glycogen-rich) tumors, as well as expression of vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF), thought to be a factor in the striking capillarization of serous 
      cystadenomas and other non-pancreatic clear cell tumors. VEGF may prove to be of 
      significant diagnostic value since its elevation in cyst fluid has recently been 
      found highly sensitive and specific for serous neoplasms. These molecular 
      alterations establish serous tumors as prototypes of clear cell tumorigenesis and 
      angiogenesis and may prove helpful both as diagnostic and non-surgical 
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - Calculation of the Ki67 index in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a comparative 
      analysis of four counting methodologies.
PG  - 686-94
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2014.156 [doi]
AB  - Ki67 index is now an essential part of classification of pancreatic 
      neuroendocrine tumors. However, its adaptation into daily practice has been 
      fraught with challenges related to counting methodology. In this study, three 
      reviewers used four counting methodologies to calculate Ki67 index in 68 
      well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: (1) 'eye-ball' estimation, 
      which has been advocated as reliable and is widely used; (2) automated counting 
      by image analyzer; (3) manual eye-counting (eye under a microscope without a 
      grid); and (4) manual count of camera-captured/printed image. Pearson's 
      correlation (R) was used to measure pair-wise correlation among three reviewers 
      using all four methodologies. Average level of agreement was calculated using 
      mean of R values. The results showed that: (1) 'eye-balling' was least expensive 
      and fastest (average time <1 min) but had poor reliability and reproducibility. 
      (2) Automated count was the most expensive and least practical with major impact 
      on turnaround time (limited by machine and personnel accessibility), and, more 
      importantly, had inaccuracies in overcounting unwanted material. (3) Manual eye 
      count had no additional cost, averaged 6 min, but proved impractical and poorly 
      reproducible. (4) Camera-captured/printed image was most reliable, had highest 
      reproducibility, but took longer than 'eye-balling'. In conclusion, based on its 
      comparatively low cost/benefit ratio and reproducibility, camera-captured/printed 
      image appears to be the most practical for calculating Ki67 index. Although 
      automated counting is generally advertised as the gold standard for index 
      calculation, in this study it was not as accurate or cost-effective as 
      camera-captured/printed image and was highly operator-dependent. 'Eye-balling' 
      produces highly inaccurate and unreliable results, and is not recommended for 
      routine use.

TI  - microRNA expression profiling identifies a four microRNA signature as a novel 
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in triple negative breast cancers.
PG  - 1174-84
AB  - Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease at the molecular 
      and clinical level with poor outcome. Molecular subclassification of TNBCs is 
      essential for optimal use of current therapies and for development of new drugs. 
      microRNAs (miRNA) are widely recognized as key players in cancer progression and 
      drug resistance; investigation of their involvement in a TNBC cohort may reveal 
      biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of TNBC. Here we stratified a large TNBC 
      cohort into Core Basal (CB, EGFR and/or CK5, 6 positive) and five negative (5NP) 
      if all markers are negative. We determined the complete miRNA expression profile 
      and found a subset of miRNAs specifically deregulated in the two subclasses.We 
      identified a 4-miRNA signature given by miR-155, miR-493, miR-30e and miR-27a 
      expression levels, that allowed subdivision of TNBCs not only into CB and 5NP 
      subgroups (sensitivity 0.75 and specificity 0.56; AUC=0.74) but also into high 
      risk and low risk groups. We tested the diagnostic and prognostic performances of 
      both the 5 IHC marker panel and the 4-miRNA expression signatures, which clearly 
      identify worse outcome patients in the treated and untreated subcohorts. Both 
      signatures have diagnostic and prognostic value, predicting outcomes of patient 
      treatment with the two most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in TNBC: 
      anthracycline or anthracycline plus taxanes. Further investigations of the 
      patients’ overall survival treated with these regimens show that regardless of 
      IHC group subdivision, taxanes addition did not benefit patients, possibly due to 
      miRNA driven taxanes resistance. TNBC subclassification based on the 5 IHC 
      markers and on the miR-155, miR-493, miR-30e, miR-27a expression levels are 
      powerful diagnostic tools. Treatment choice and new drug development should 
      consider this new subtyping and miRNA expression signature in planning low 
      toxicity, maximum efficacy therapies.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancers are a heterogeneous group of tumors characterized 
      by poor patient survival and lack of targeted therapeutics. Androgen receptor has 
      been associated with triple negative breast cancer pathogenesis, but its role in 
      the different subtypes has not been clearly defined. We examined androgen 
      receptor protein expression by immunohistochemical analysis in 678 breast 
      cancers, including 396 triple negative cancers. Fifty matched lymph node 
      metastases were also examined. Association of expression status with clinical 
      (race, survival) and pathological (basal, non-basal subtype, stage, grade) 
      features was also evaluated. In 160 triple negative breast cancers, mRNA 
      microarray expression profiling was performed, and differences according to 
      androgen receptor status were analyzed. In triple negative cancers the percentage 
      of androgen receptor positive cases was lower (24.8% vs 81.6% of non-triple 
      negative cases), especially in African American women (16.7% vs 25.5% of cancers 
      of white women). No significant difference in androgen receptor expression was 
      observed in primary tumors vs matched metastatic lesions. Positive androgen 
      receptor immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with tumor grade (p<0.01) and 
      associated with better overall patient survival (p = 0.032) in the non-basal 
      triple negative cancer group. In the microarray study, expression of three genes 
      (HER4, TNFSF10, CDK6) showed significant deregulation in association with 
      androgen receptor status; eg CDK6, a novel therapeutic target in triple negative 
      cancers, showed significantly higher expression level in androgen receptor 
      negative cases (p<0.01). These findings confirm the prognostic impact of androgen 
      receptor expression in non-basal triple negative breast cancers, and suggest 
      targeting of new androgen receptor-related molecular pathways in patients with 
      these cancers.

TI  - Whipple made simple for surgical pathologists: orientation, dissection, and 
      sampling of pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens for a more practical and accurate 
      evaluation of pancreatic, distal common bile duct, and ampullary tumors.
PG  - 480-93
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000165 [doi]
AB  - Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) specimens present a challenge for surgical 
      pathologists because of the relative rarity of these specimens, combined with the 
      anatomic complexity. Here, we describe our experience on the orientation, 
      dissection, and sampling of PD specimens for a more practical and accurate 
      evaluation of pancreatic, distal common bile duct (CBD), and ampullary tumors. 
      For orientation of PDs, identification of the "trapezoid," created by the 
      vascular bed at the center, the pancreatic neck margin on the left, and the 
      uncinate margin on the right, is of outmost importance in finding all the 
      pertinent margins of the specimen including the CBD, which is located at the 
      upper right edge of this trapezoid. After orientation, all the margins can be 
      sampled. We submit the uncinate margin entirely as a perpendicular inked margin 
      because this adipose tissue-rich area often reveals subtle satellite carcinomas 
      that are grossly invisible, and, with this approach, the number of R1 resections 
      has doubled in our experience. Then, to ensure proper identification of all lymph 
      nodes (LNs), we utilize the orange-peeling approach, in which the soft tissue 
      surrounding the pancreatic head is shaved off in 7 arbitrarily defined regions, 
      which also serve as shaved samples of the so-called "peripancreatic soft tissue" 
      that defines pT3 in the current American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM. With this 
      approach, our LN count increased from 6 to 14 and LN positivity rate from 50% to 
      73%. In addition, in 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas there are grossly 
      undetected microfoci of carcinoma. For determination of the primary site and the 
      extent of the tumor, we believe bisectioning of the pancreatic head, instead of 
      axial (transverse) slicing, is the most revealing approach. In addition, 
      documentation of the findings in the duodenal surface of the ampulla is crucial 
      for ampullary carcinomas and their recent site-specific categorization into 4 
      categories. Therefore, we probe both the CBD and the pancreatic duct from distal 
      to the ampulla and cut the pancreatic head to the ampulla at a plane that goes 
      through both ducts. Then, we sample the bisected pancreatic head depending on the 
      findings of the case. For example, for proper staging of ampullary carcinomas, it 
      is imperative to take the sections perpendicular to the duodenal serosa at the 
      "groove" area, as ampullary carcinomas often extend to this region. Amputative 
      (axial) sectioning of the ampulla, although good for documentation of the 
      peri-Oddi spread of the intra-ampullary tumors, unfortunately disallows 
      documentation of mucosal spread of the papilla of Vater tumors (those arising 
      from the edge of the ampulla, where the ducts transition to duodenal mucosa and 
      extending) into the neighboring duodenum. Axial sectioning also often fails to 
      document tumor spread to the "groove" area. In conclusion, knowledge of the gross 
      characteristics of the anatomic hallmarks is essential for proper dissection of 
      PD specimens. The approach described above allows practical and accurate 
      documentation and staging of pancreas, distal CBD, and ampullary cancers.

TI  - Molecular genetics of pancreatic neoplasms and their morphologic correlates: an 
      update on recent advances and potential diagnostic applications.
PG  - 168-80
LID - 10.1309/AJCP0FKDP7ENVKEV [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize the most clinically and biologically relevant advances 
      in molecular/genetic characteristics of various pancreatic neoplasms, with 
      morphologic correlation. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing of numerous benign and 
      malignant pancreatic tumors, along with the plethora of highly sensitive 
      molecular studies now available for analyzing these tumors, provide mounting 
      evidence to support the long-held belief that cancer is essentially a genetic 
      disease. These genetic discoveries have not only helped to confirm the age-old, 
      morphology-based classifications of pancreatic neoplasia but have shed new light 
      on their mechanisms. Many of these molecular discoveries are currently being used 
      in preoperative diagnosis. RESULTS: Mutations in KRAS, P16/CDKN2A, TP53, and 
      SMAD4/DPC4 are commonly seen in ductal neoplasia but not in nonductal tumors; 
      ductal adenocarcinomas with SMAD4/DPC4 loss are associated with widespread 
      metastasis and poor prognosis. GNAS and RNF43 mutations have been discovered in 
      most intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms, providing critical molecular 
      fingerprints for their diagnosis. Mutation in DAXX/ATRX is only seen in 
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, making it a useful potential marker in 
      distinguishing these tumors from mimics. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with 
      morphologic observations, molecular studies will increase our understanding of 
      the pathogenesis and morphomolecular signatures associated with specific 
      neoplasms and provide new horizons for precision medicine and targeted therapies.

TI  - Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas: current concepts and controversies.
PG  - 65-79
LID - 10.1007/s12022-013-9295-2 [doi]
AB  - In the past decade, the clinico-pathologic characteristics of neuroendocrine 
      tumors (NETs) in the pancreas have been further elucidated. Previously termed 
      "islet cell tumors/carcinomas" or "endocrine neoplasms", they are now called 
      pancreatic NETs (PanNETs). They occur in relatively younger patients and may 
      arise anywhere in the pancreas. Some are associated with von Hippel-Lindau, MEN1, 
      and other syndromes. It is now widely recognized that, with the exception of 
      tumorlets (minute incipient neoplasms) that occur in some syndromes like MEN1, 
      all PanNETs are malignant, albeit low-grade, and although they have a protracted 
      clinical course and overall 10-year survival of 60-70 %, even low-stage and 
      low-grade examples may recur and/or metastasize on long-term follow-up. Per 
      recent consensus guidelines adopted by both European and North American NET 
      Societies (ENETS and NANETs) and WHO-2010, PanNETs are now graded and staged 
      separately, unlike previous classification schemes that used a combination of 
      grade, stage, and adjunct prognosticators in an attempt to define "benign 
      behavior" or "malignant" categories. For staging, the ENETs proposal may be more 
      applicable than CAP/AJCC, which is based on the staging of exocrine tumors. 
      Current grading of PanNETs is based on mitotic activity and ki-67 index. Other 
      promising prognosticators such as necrosis, CK19, c-kit, and others are still 
      under investigation. It has also been recognized that PanNETs have a rather wide 
      morphologic repertoire including oncocytic, pleomorphic, ductulo-insular, 
      sclerosing, and lipid-rich variants. Most PanNETs are diagnosed by fine needle 
      aspiration biopsy, in which single, monotonous plasmacytoid cells with fair 
      amounts of cytoplasm and distinctive neuroendocrine chromatin are diagnostic. 
      Molecular alterations of PanNETs are also very different than that of ductal or 
      acinar tumors. Loss of expression of DAXX and ATRX proteins has been recently 
      identified in 45 %. Along with these improvements, several controversies remain, 
      including grading, value of current cutoff ranges, and the best methods for 
      counting ki-67 index (manual count by computer-captured image may be the most 
      practical for the time being). More important is the controversial use of the 
      term "carcinoma", which was previously employed in WHO-2004 only for invasive and 
      metastatic cases but has now been made synonymous with grade 3 group of tumors. 
      It is becoming clear that grade 3 group comprises two distinct categories: (1) 
      differentiated but proliferatively more active tumors which typically have ki-67 
      indices in the 20-50 % range and (2) true poorly differentiated NE carcinomas as 
      defined in the lung, with ki-67 typically >50 %. Further studies are needed to 
      address these controversial aspects of PanNETs.

TI  - Pituitary adenoma with gangliocytic component: report of 5 cases with focus on 
      immunoprofile of gangliocytic component.
PG  - 23-30
LID - 10.1007/s11102-013-0551-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pituitary adenomas with gangliocytic component are rare tumors of 
      the sellar region that are composed of pituitary adenoma cells and a ganglion 
      cell component. Their histogenesis and hence nosology is not yet resolved because 
      of the small number of cases reported and lack of large series in the literature. 
      METHODS: Herein we report five cases of pituitary adenoma with gangliocytic 
      component to add knowledge to this rare neoplasm. RESULTS: Three cases are 
      functional mammosomatotroph adenomas, one case is functional sparsely granulated 
      somatotroph adenoma and the other is functional corticotroph adenoma. 
      Gangliocytic component showed immunohistochemical expression of hormones in three 
      cases. The ganglion cells were prolactin immunoreactive in case 1, GH and TSH 
      immunoreactive in case 5 and showed expression of prolactin, TSH, ACTH and FSH in 
      case 4. Three cases had undergone more than one surgery of which two had 
      gangliocytic cells only in the recurrent tumors whereas the third case showed 
      gangliocytic cells only in the initial tumor. DISCUSSION: The cases are discussed 
      with clinical and histological features and a brief review of the literature 
      considering the histogenesis is included.

      comparison of areas with or without classical nuclear features.
PG  - 241-7
LID - 10.1007/s12022-013-9275-6 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to compare the genetic background of different areas in follicular 
      variant papillary thyroid carcinomas (FVPTC) with or without classical nuclear 
      changes. Sixteen cases of FVPTC were included in our study. All tumors were well 
      demarcated from surrounding thyroid tissue and had both areas with nuclear 
      features (WNF) and areas without nuclear features (WONF) of papillary carcinoma. 
      DNA is obtained by laser microdissection from WNF and WONF areas of each case. 
      Point mutations for NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and BRAF were investigated by 
      direct sequencing. In 11 cases, reverse transcription PCR was performed for the 
      presence of PAX8-PPARɣ and RET/PTC1-3 gene rearrangements. Point mutation for 
      NRAS codon 61 was also studied in 15 colloidal nodules. Seven cases (44 %) showed 
      at least one mutation; two cases (13 %) revealed the same mutation in both WNF 
      and WONF areas, while in the rest only WNF areas were mutated. None of the 
      studied 11 cases demonstrated RET/PTC1-3 gene rearrangement and in only one case 
      PAX8-PPARɣ gene rearrangement was found. Six cases (38 %) showed NRAS codon 61 
      mutation, involving only WNF areas in five cases and both WNF and WONF areas in 
      one case. Neither HRAS codon 61 nor BRAF mutations were present. Fifteen 
      colloidal nodules were also wild type for NRAS codon 61. Our findings suggest 
      that NRAS codon 61 point mutations and PAX8-PPARɣ gene rearrangement play a role 
      in the FVPTC pathogenesis and may be established before the 
      morphological/phenotypical features fully develop.

LID - 10.1631/jzus.B1300016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the degree of biocompatibility and 
      neuroregeneration of a polymer tube, poly-3-hydroxyoctanoate (PHO) in nerve gap 
      repair. METHODS: Forty Wistar Albino male rats were randomized into two groups: 
      autologous nerve gap repair group and PHO tube repair group. In each group, a 
      10-mm right sciatic nerve defect was created and reconstructed accordingly. 
      Neuroregeneration was studied by sciatic function index (SFI), electromyography, 
      and immunohistochemical studies on Days 7, 21, 45 and 60 of implantation. 
      Biocompatibility was analyzed by the capsule formation around the conduit. 
      Biodegradation was analyzed by the molecular weight loss in vivo. RESULTS: 
      Electrophysiological and histomorphometric assessments demonstrated 
      neuroregeneration in both groups over time. In the experimental group, a straight 
      alignment of the Schwann cells parallel to the axons was detected. However, 
      autologous nerve graft seems to have a superior neuroregeneration compared to PHO 
      grafts. Minor biodegradation was observed in PHO conduit at the end of 60 d. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although neuroregeneration is detected in PHO grafts with minor 
      degradation in 60 d, autologous nerve graft is found to be superior in axonal 
      regeneration compared to PHO nerve tube grafts. PHO conduits were found to create 
      minor inflammatory reaction in vivo, resulting in good soft tissue response.

      cell carcinomas. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight angiomyolipomas and 19 renal 
      cell carcinomas were prospectively examined with real-time elastography. Lesions 
      were classified according to four elastographic patterns on the basis of the 
      distribution of the blue area (representing no strain and hardest tissue 
      component). The elasticity patterns and the strain ratios of the angiomyolipomas 
      and renal cell carcinomas were evaluated independently by two observers. 
      Diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement were analyzed. RESULTS: All 
      angiomyolipomas were classified as having a high-strain elastographic pattern 
      (blue areas in < 50% of lesion, considered type 1 or type 2) by both 
      radiologists, whereas 18 of 19 renal cell carcinomas were classified as having a 
      low-strain elastographic pattern (blue areas in ≥ 50% of lesion, considered type 
      3 or 4) by both radiologists. The respective mean strain ratios measured by two 
      radiologists were 0.15 ± 0.06 and 0.18 ± 0.09 for the angiomyolipomas and 0.64 ± 
      0.15 and 0.63 ± 0.19 for the renal cell carcinomas. There were significant 
      differences between the elasticity patterns and strain ratios for angiomyolipomas 
      and renal cell carcinomas (p < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was excellent for 
      elasticity patterns and strain ratios, with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.96 
      and an intraclass correlation coefficient score of 0.95. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      show that real-time elastography may be useful in differentiating angiomyolipomas 
      from renal cell carcinomas, by use of both elasticity patterns and strain ratios.

AB  - Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive autoimmune disorder 
      characterized by recurrent bouts of fever and serosal inflammation. FMF may be 
      complicated by AA-type amyloidosis, worsening the prognosis, with associated 
      renal failure in some patients. Complication rate varies with race, being as high 
      as 60% in Turks and as low as 2% in Armenians. In a few cases of patients with 
      FMF (phenotype 2), amyloid nephropathy may be the presenting manifestation. This 
      study included 420 patients who were admitted to the Nephrology and Rheumatology 
      Departments of Atatürk Education and Research Hospital with unexplained 
      proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome. The initial screening test for amyloidosis was 
      the presence of significant proteinuria (300 mg/24 h). All MEFV gene exons were 
      screened for causative mutations by direct DNA sequencing to check for any 
      mutations. There were 22 phenotype 2 FMF patients with 27 allelic variants. The 
      most prevalent allelic variants were M694V (10/27, 37%) and E148Q (7/27, 26%). 
      Phenotype 2 FMF is not as rare as it was thought before; this should be kept in 
      mind for all patients with unexplained proteinuria and/or acute phase response in 
      high-risk ethnic groups for FMF.

TI  - Pathologic staging of pancreatic, ampullary, biliary, and gallbladder cancers: 
      pitfalls and practical limitations of the current AJCC/UICC TNM staging system 
      and opportunities for improvement.
PG  - 127-41

AB  - Tumors of the ampulla-pancreatobiliary tract are encountered increasingly; 
      however, their staging can be highly challenging due to lack of familiarity. In 
      this review article, the various issues encountered in staging of these tumors at 
      the pathologic level are evaluated and possible solutions for daily practice as 
      well as potential improvements for future staging protocols are discussed. While 
      N-stage parameters have now been well established (the number of lymph nodes 
      required in pancreatoduodenectomies is 12), the T-staging has several issues: for 
      the pancreas, the discovery of small cancers arising in intraductal papillary 
      mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) necessitates the 
      creation of substages of T1 (as T1a, b, and c); lack of proper definition of 
      "peripancreatic soft tissue" and "common bile duct involvement" (as to which part 
      is meant) makes T3 highly subjective. Increasing resectability of main vessels 
      (portal vein) brings the need to redefine a "T" for such cases. For the ampulla, 
      due to factors like anatomic complexity of the region and the under-appreciation 
      of three-dimensional spread of the tumors in this area (in particular, the 
      frequent extension into periduodenal soft tissues and duodenal serosa, which are 
      not addressed in the current system and which require specific grossing 
      approaches to document), the current T-staging lacks reproducibility and clinical 
      relevance, and therefore, major revisions are needed. Recently proposed refined 
      definition and site-specific subclassification of ampullary tumors highlight the 
      areas for improvement. For the extrahepatic bile ducts, the staging schemes that 
      use the depth of invasion may be more practical to circumvent the inconsistencies 
      in the histologic layering of the ducts; better definition of terms like 
      "periductal spread" is needed. For the gallbladder, since many gallbladder 
      cancers are "unapparent" (found in clinically and grossly unsuspected 
      cholecystectomies), establishing proper grossing protocols and adequate sampling 
      are crucial. Since the gallbladder does not have the distinct layering of the 
      other gastrointestinal organs, the definitions of Tis/T1a/T1b lack practicality, 
      and therefore, "early gallbladder carcinoma" category proposed in high-risk 
      regions may have to be recognized instead. Involvement of the Rokitansky-Aschoff 
      sinuses should be a part of the evaluation and management of these early 
      gallbladder cancers; for advanced cancers, documentation of hepatic versus 
      serosal involvement is necessary. In summary, T-staging of 
      ampulla-pancreatobiliary tract tumors has many challenges. Proper grossing and 
      appreciation of histo-anatomic subtleties of this region are crucial in 
      addressing these issues and achieving more applicable and clinically relevant 
      staging systems in the future.

TI  - Ampullary region carcinomas: definition and site specific classification with 
      delineation of four clinicopathologically and prognostically distinct subsets in 
      an analysis of 249 cases.
PG  - 1592-608

AB  - Ampullary (AMP) carcinomas comprise a heterogeneous group of cancers lacking 
      adequate subcategorization. In the present study, 249 strictly defined primary 
      AMP carcinomas (ACs) identified in 1469 malignant pancreatoduodenectomy specimens 
      were analyzed for defining features. Gross and microscopic findings were used to 
      determine tumor epicenter and extent of preinvasive component. ACs were 
      classified into 4 distinct subtypes based on location: (1) Intra-AMP (25%): 
      Invasive carcinomas arising in intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasms with 
      zero to minimal, duodenal surface involvement (<25% of the tumor). These tumors 
      were more commonly found in men, they had a relatively large overall size (mean, 
      2.9 cm) but had smaller invasive component (mean, 1.5 cm), and were predominantly 
      of a lower TNM stage (85%, T1/2; and 72% N0). They carried the best prognosis 
      among the 4 groups (3-y survival, 73%). (2) AMP-ductal (15%): These were tumors 
      forming constrictive, sclerotic, plaque-like thickening of the walls of the 
      common bile duct and/or pancreatic duct resulting in mucosa-covered, button-like 
      elevations of the papilla into the duodenal lumen. There was no significant 
      exophytic (preinvasive) growth. These were the smallest tumors (mean overall 
      size, 1.9 cm; mean invasion size 1.7 cm), but carried the worst prognosis (3-y 
      survival, 41%), presumably due to the pancreatobiliary histology/origin (in 86%); 
      however, even this group had significantly better prognosis when compared with 
      113 ordinary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (3 y, 11%; P<0.0001). (3) 
      Peri-AMP-duodenal (5%): Massive exophytic, ulcero-fungating tumors growing into 
      the duodenal lumen and eccentrically encasing the ampullary orifice with only 
      minimal intra-ampullary luminal involvement. These were mostly of intestinal 
      phenotype (75%) and some had mucinous features. Although these tumors were the 
      largest (mean overall size 4.7 cm; and mean invasion size 3.4 cm), and had the 
      highest incidence of lymph node metastasis (50%), they carried an intermediate 
      prognosis (3-y survival, 69%) to that seen among a group of 55 nonampullary 
      duodenal carcinoma controls. (4) AC-not otherwise specified ("papilla of Vater"; 
      55%): Ulcero-nodular tumors located at the papilla of Vater, which do not show 
      the specific characteristics identified among the other 3 subtypes. In 
      conclusion, ACs comprise 4 clinicopathologic subtypes that are prognostically 
      distinct.

TI  - The situation of consultation practice in pathology in Turkey.
PG  - 195-203
LID - 10.5146/tjpath.2012.01125 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are some suggestions regarding the methods of consultation 
      practice in the literature including which case will be consulted, to whom, by 
      which transport means, the payment methods as well as the ethical issues. There 
      are no standards for consultations in Turkey. The standardization committee of 
      the Federation of Turkish Pathology Societies has conducted a survey to detect 
      the current situation, determine the problematic aspects, compare the situation 
      with international methods and offer methods specific to Turkey. MATERIAL AND 
      METHOD: A survey has been prepared to cover all the aspects of consultation 
      practice using the literature and referring to the current methods used in 
      Turkey. The survey has been announced on the internet and 83 replies were 
      collected. RESULTS: Multiple choice questions were evaluated in terms of 
      percentages and open ended questions were grouped according to the answer 
      contents. It was seen that problems could be grouped as follows: absence of 
      written procedures covering each step, means of transport, reaching the 
      consultant, payment, reporting and ethical issues. The absence of procedures and 
      issues regarding the payment methods were the interfering factors for each step 
      of consultation. CONCLUSION: There are many problematic issues in consultation 
      practice in pathology in Turkey. The basis of these problems is the absence of 
      written regulations for procedural and payment methods. Regulations addressing 
      these issues should be developed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme (ERCC1) plays a key 
      role in the removal of platinum induced DNA adducts and cisplatin resistance. 
      Prognostic role of ERCC1 expression in the neoadjuvant setting in bladder cancer 
      has not been reported before. We evaluated the prognostic role of ERCC1 
      expression in bladder cancer receiving platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer 
      who received neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy were included. Clinical and 
      histopathologic parameters along with immunohistochemical ERCC1 staining were 
      examined and correlated with response rates and survival. RESULTS: Pathologic 
      complete response rates were similar between patients with low and high ERCC1 
      expression. Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 9.3 vs. 20.5 months (P = 
      0.186) and median overall survival (OS) was 9.3 vs. 26.7 months (P = 0.058) in 
      patients with high ERCC1 expression compared with those with low expression, 
      respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analysis: pathological complete 
      response (pCR) after chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.1, 95% CI 0.012-0.842, P = 
      0.034) and high ERCC1 expression (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.2, P = 0.019) were 
      significantly associated with DFS. Patient age (>60 vs. ≤ 60 years) (HR 3.4, 95% 
      CI 1.2-9.4, P = 0.018), the presence of pCR (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.014-0.981, P = 
      0.048) and high ERCC expression (HR 6.1, 95 CI 1.9-19.9, P = 0.002) were 
      significantly associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that high ERCC1 
      expression was independently associated with shorter disease-free and overall 
      survival in patients with bladder cancer who received neoadjuvant platinum-based 
      chemotherapy. ERCC1 may represent a potential predictive marker for 
      platinum-based treatment in bladder cancer.

TI  - Optic glioma in children: a retrospective analysis of 101 cases.
PG  - 287-92
LID - 10.1097/COC.0b013e3182467efa [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and long-term outcome of pediatric 
      patients with optic glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 101 patients with 
      optic glioma newly diagnosed between 1975 and 2008 were evaluated 
      retrospectively. COPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone) 
      and cisplatin plus etoposide were the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens. 
      Radiotherapy was administered in patients with progressive or unresponsive 
      disease. RESULTS: The median age at the time of diagnosis was 6 years, and the 
      male/female ratio was 1.15. The most common referral complaint was strabismus. 
      The most common site of optic glioma was the hypothalamic-chiasmatic region 
      (31.7%). Fifty-three patients (52.5%) had neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). 
      Treatment consisted of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Forty-nine 
      patients (48.5%) underwent surgery, which was predominantly subtotal resection, 
      radiotherapy was administered to 39.4%, and 30 patients received chemotherapy. 
      The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 
      65.8% and 88.4%, respectively, and the 10-year PFS and OS were 54.2% and 83.4%, 
      respectively, with an 8-year median follow-up. OS was significantly lower in 
      patients with hypothalamo-chiasmatic involvement and significantly higher in 
      patients with NF-1. The 5- and 10-year PFS rates were significantly higher in 
      patients 10 years or older at diagnosis (P=0.0001) and in patients with 
      intraorbital involvement (P=0.032). Eighteen patients (17.8%) died of disease. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NF-l and those older than 10 years have a better 
      prognosis, whereas patients younger than 3 years and those with 
      hypothalamic-chiasmatic optic glioma have a worse outcome. Further studies are 
      needed to find appropriate treatment strategies.

TI  - Stem cell-related markers in primary breast cancers and associated metastatic 
      lesions.
PG  - 949-55
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2012.37 [doi]
AB  - It has been reported previously that: (1) normal-breast epithelial cells that are 
      CD24-/44+ express higher levels of stem/progenitor cell-associated genes; (2) 
      cancer cells that have undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition display 
      CD24-/44+ cell-surface expression, a marker for breast cancer stem cells; (3) 
      loss of E-cadherin is a preliminary step in epithelial to mesenchymal transition; 
      and (4) vimentin is a marker of mesenchymal phenotype. We hypothesized that stem 
      cell subpopulations would be more frequent in metastatic than in primary tumors. 
      Therefore we assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, tissue microarrays 
      containing tissue from primary and associated metastatic breast cancers for 
      expression of CD24, CD44, E-cadherin and vimentin to evaluate candidate 
      cancer-initiating cell populations in breast cancer subtypes and metastatic 
      lesions. The occurrence of CD24-/44+ and CD24+/44- cells did not differ in 
      primary vs matched lymph node or distant and locoregional metastatic lesions; 
      E-cadherin expression was decreased in primary vs lymph node metastases (P=0.018) 
      but not decreased in distant and locoregional metastases relative to primary 
      tumor, whereas vimentin, was more frequently expressed in lymph node and distant 
      and locoregional metastases (P=0.013, P=0.004) than in matched primary cancers. 
      Thus, the frequency of CD24-/44+ cells does not differ in metastases relative to 
      the primary breast cancer but differs by tumor stage and subtype.

TI  - Aquaporin-4 expression is not elevated in mild hydrocephalus.
PG  - 753-9; discussion 759
LID - 10.1007/s00701-011-1241-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aquaporin-4 (aqp-4) is a member of water channel family proteins 
      primarily expressed in the central nervous system. Physiologically it is the main 
      channel providing water transport into the nervous system water compartments and 
      across the blood-brain barrier. Several studies demonstrated its compensatory 
      role in severe hydrocephalus. However, its role is not clear during the initial 
      stages of hydrocephalus. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate aqp-4 
      expression in less severe forms of hydrocephalus and to determine its role in 
      disease progression. METHODS: Twenty-five male Wistar-Hannover rats, were 
      distributed into experimental (n = 20) and control (n = 5) groups. Hydrocephalus 
      was induced in the experimental group by injection of 5 μl 25% kaolin suspension 
      into the cisterna magna. Control animals received an injection of 5 μl normal 
      saline. Eight weeks later, the animals were killed by the perfusion-fixation 
      method. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis were performed. RESULTS: 
      Ventricular dilatations were noted in all experimental animals. Both groups 
      demonstrated positive immunoreactive signals to aqp-4. Immunohistochemically 
      there were no changes in aqp-4 pattern and expression intensity between 
      experimental and control animals. Similarly, Western blot analysis revealed mean 
      aqp-4 values in experimental and control groups as 0.3436 and 0.3917, 
      respectively, and the difference did not reach statistical significance (p > 
      0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that aqp-4 is not up-regulated during the 
      initial stages of hydrocephalus. This implies that aqp-4 may not play a 
      significant role in hydrocephalus compensation until severe ventricular 
      dilatation occurs.

TI  - Expression of water channel aquaporin-4 during experimental syringomyelia: 
      laboratory investigation.
PG  - 428-32
LID - 10.3171/2011.5.SPINE10303 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Aquaporins (aqp) are protein channels providing water transport across 
      cell membranes. The main member of this family expressed in the CNS is aqp-4. The 
      pattern and amount of expression of this channel suggest a dominant role in bulk 
      water movement into the nervous tissue. It has also been shown to play a role in 
      several water balance disorders in the CNS. In this study, the authors 
      investigated the possible role of aqp-4 in syringomyelia. METHODS: Twenty-five 
      male Wistar-Hannover rats were divided into experimental (20 rats) and control (5 
      rats) groups. Syringomyelia was induced in the experimental group by kaolin 
      injection into the cisterna magna. Eight weeks later, the animals were killed, 
      and their spinal cords were removed. Central canal dilations were noted in all 
      experimental animals. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were 
      performed to evaluate aqp-4 expression. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated 
      positive immunoreactive signals to aqp-4. Western blot analysis revealed a slight 
      decrease in the mean aqp-4 value in the experimental group; however, the 
      difference did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). Immunohistochemical 
      analysis showed a similar pattern and intensity of aqp-4 staining in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that aqp-4 most likely does not 
      play a major role in chronic syringomyelia. Its slight downregulation during the 
      initial stage of syrinx formation is possibly a compensatory mechanism. This 
      effect is not present during the late stage of syringomyelia, and aqp-4 is most 
      likely not involved in the pathophysiology of syrinx cavity formation.

AB  - Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystemic, non-caseating granulomatous disease of 
      unknown etiology. Nasopharyngeal involvement is very rare in sarcoidosis. The 
      objective of this report was to evaluate a rare involvement of sarcoidosis. This 
      report includes a case of nasopharyngeal sarcoidosis. A 51-year-old female with 
      nasopharyngeal sarcoidosis was treated as sarcoidosis, and she was better. 
      Nasopharyngeal involvement is very rare in sarcoidosis but it must be kept in 
      mind.

TI  - GLUT-1 expression in pancreatic neoplasia: implications in pathogenesis, 
      diagnosis, and prognosis.
PG  - 187-92
LID - 10.1097/MPA.0b013e318201c935 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: GLUT-1 has been found to have an important role in the upregulation 
      of various cellular pathways and implicated in neoplastic transformation 
      correlating with biological behavior in malignancies. However, literature 
      regarding the significance of GLUT-1 expression in pancreatic neoplasia has been 
      limited and controversial. METHODS: Immunohistochemical expression of GLUT-1 was 
      tested in a variety of pancreatic neoplasia including ductal adenocarcinomas 
      (DAs), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs), intraductal papillary 
      mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and serous cystadenomas. RESULTS: There was a 
      progressive increase in the expression of GLUT-1 from low- to higher-grade 
      dysplastic lesions: All higher-grade PanINs/IPMNs (the ones with 
      moderate/high-grade dysplasia) revealed noticeable GLUT-1 expression. Among the 
      94 DAs analyzed, there were minimal/moderate expression in 46 and significant 
      expression in 24 DAs. However, all 4 clear-cell variants of DAs revealed 
      significant GLUT-1 immunolabeling, as did areas of clear-cell change seen in 
      other DAs. Moreover, all 12 serous cystadenomas expressed significant GLUT-1. 
      GLUT-1 expression was also directly correlated with DA histological grade (P = 
      0.016) and tumor size (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: GLUT-1 may give rise to the 
      distinctive clear-cell appearance of these tumors by inducing the accumulation of 
      glycogen in the cytoplasm. Additionally, because GLUT-1 expression was related to 
      histological grade and tumor size of DA, further studies are warranted to 
      investigate the association of GLUT-1 with prognosis and tumor progression.

AB  - An 11-year-old boy presented with a mid-zonal pigment epithelial iris cyst. The 
      cyst progressed relentlessly, ultimately leading to enucleation of the eye 4 
      years after presentation. Histopathology revealed a ciliary body schwannoma 
      filling the anterior chamber and a small, incidental noncontiguous ciliary body 
      melanoma. Vision loss, pupil distortion, and relentless growth despite complete 
      cyst deflation following aspiration were clues for the tumor-induced nature of 
      the visible cyst.

TI  - Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the cervix: case report and review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 181-4
LID - 10.1097/PGP.0b013e3181b70176 [doi]
AB  - Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix has 5 subtypes: endocervical, intestinal, 
      signet-ring cell, minimal deviation, and villoglandular. There are only rare 
      reports of primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the cervix in the literature. 
      Herein we report a 53-year-old woman with cervical adenocarcinoma with 
      signet-ring cell morphology. Thorough systemic examination did not reveal another 
      primary focus. DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded tissue revealed the presence 
      of human papilloma virus (HPV) type 18, which supports the cervical origin of the 
      tumor. Signet-ring cell morphology can be observed in both benign and malignant 
      lesions of the uterine cervix. Most of the malignant lesions are metastatic. 
      Histological features and immunohistochemical profiles are discussed, and a 
      review of signet-ring cell morphology in the uterine cervix is included.

TI  - Omentectomy for gynecologic cancer: how much sampling is adequate for microscopic 
      examination?
PG  - 1578-81
AB  - CONTEXT: Detecting omental metastasis is crucial for staging and treatment of 
      endometrial and ovarian carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal omental 
      sampling for omentectomies to ascertain the stage of the disease in a 
      cost-effective way. DESIGN: We reevaluated 258 omentectomies that were performed 
      due to ovarian or endometrial carcinoma. A total of 116 cases were 
      retrospectively studied, and 142 cases were prospectively studied. For 
      prospective study, 10 to 16 blocks were sampled if the omentum showed no signs of 
      gross tumor. Mean omental block sample frequency of 2 groups with the negative 
      macroscopy but with or without microscopic tumor have been compared using an 
      independent samples t test. RESULTS: Seven patients had no evidence of tumor 
      metastasis on gross examination but had microscopic tumor metastasis. The mean 
      numbers of blocks were 6.4 for patients having microscopic tumor without 
      macroscopic involvement and 7.8 for patients having neither microscopic nor 
      macroscopic involvement. Approximately twice as many samples were taken in the 
      prospective analysis when compared with retrospective analysis. Two cases with 
      microscopic omental metastasis that had no macroscopic involvement at first 
      impression were reevaluated retrospectively and found to contain 0.3- to 0.5-cm 
      white nodules. The rate of omental metastasis increased with the grade of the 
      tumor (P = .005). CONCLUSION: Careful macroscopic examination is the most 
      important step in detecting small omental metastasis. For cases with gross tumor, 
      one section is sufficient. If a macroscopic lesion is not detectable and the 
      patient has a high-grade tumor that will necessitate an adjuvant therapy, 3 to 5 
      samples seem sufficient for staging. Further studies are needed to determine the 
      optimum sample size for tumors having a low risk of metastasis.
