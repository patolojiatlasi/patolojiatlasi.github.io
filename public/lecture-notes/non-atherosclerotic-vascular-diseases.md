# Layers of vessels

- **Intima**
  - **Endothelial cell monolayer**
  - **Basal membrane**
  - **Internal elastic lamina**
- **Media**
  - **Smooth muscle cells and ECM**
  - **Loose connective tissue, nerve fibers, and smaller vessels of the
    adventitia**
  - **External elastic lamina**
- **Adventitia**
  - **Vasa vasorum**

# Arteries

- **Large elastic arteries**
  - **Aorta, arch vessels, iliac and pulmonary arteries**
  - **Elastic fibers alternate with smooth muscle cells throughout the
    media**
  - **Expands during systole, recoils during diastole**
  - **Older age, the elasticity is lost**
    - **transmit high arterial pressures to distal organs**
    - **dilated and tortuous (ectatic) prone to rupture**
- **Medium-sized muscular arteries**
  - **Coronary and renal arteries**
  - **Elastin limited to the internal and external elastic lamina**
  - **Media is composed primarily of smooth muscle cells**
    - **Circularly or spirally arranged around the lumen**
  - **Regional blood flow is regulated**

    - **Autonomic nervous system, local metabolic factors, acidosis**

**Small arteries (\<2mm)**

**Arterioles (20-100 µm)**

**Connective tissue of organs**

**Media mostly composed of smooth muscle**

**Arterioles regulate blood flow resistance**

**Flow becomes steady rather than pulsatile**

# Capillaries

**7-8µm, diameter of RBC**

**Lined by endothelial cells**

**Smooth muscle cell-like cells → pericytes**

**Rapid exchange of diffusible substances between blood and tissue**

**Diffusion of oxygen and nutrients is not efficient beyond 100 µm**

**Metabolically active tissues (heart) have the highest capillary
density**

# Veins

- **Compared to arteries**

  - **Veins larger diameters, larger lumina, and thinner walls, less
    distinct layers**

- **Prone to dilation, external compression, and penetration by tumors
  or inflammatory processes**

- **Veins have 2/3 of blood**

  - **Valves work against gravity**

# Lymphatics

**Thin-walled, endothelium-lined channels**

**Excess fluid**

**Proteins**

**Mononuclear cells**

**Tumors and infections**
