# Amyloidosis

* __Deposit\, accumulation of fibrillar proteins__
* __Causes are many inherited and inflammatory disorders__
* __Extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins__
  * __responsible for tissue damage and functional compromise__
  * __Misfolded proteins or protein fragments\, normally soluble accumulate__
    * __Abnormal fibrils__

# PATHOGENESIS OF AMYLOID DEPOSITION

# Amyloid

* __A disorder of protein misfolding__
* __Not a structurally homogeneous protein__
  * __more than 25 different protein__
* __But has same morphologic appearance__

  * __7\.5 to 10 nm in diameter__
  * __Formed of β\-sheet polypeptide chains__
  * __Congo red stain binds to these fibrils and produces a red–green birefringence__

__the traditional approaches to therapy focus on treating the underlying disease—specifically\, chemotherapy for myeloma \(with AL amyloidosis\) and antibiotics for chronic infections or anti\- inflammatory agents for autoimmune diseases \(with AA amyloidosis\)\.__

__Some breakthroughs appear imminent\, however: Building on an improved understanding of protein folding\, research has led to production of a number of useful small molecules—so\-called “amyloid breakers\,” now entering into clinical trial\. Some of these interfere with the binding of chaperone proteins such as substance P and apolipoprotein E4 \(apoE4\)\, which can propagate the β\-sheet content of Aβ peptides and promote pathogenic fibril formation in the brain: CPHPC is a carboxypyrrolidinyl carboxylic acid derivative that binds to the P component and results in its prompt removal from the circulation thus eliminating an important “nucleation factor” for amyloid propagation\. Other agents such as tramiprosate inhibit the interactions between interstitial glycosaminoglycans and Aβ that normally stabilize fibril formation; these breakers are sulfated glycosaminoglycan mimetics\. Yet another approach is to stabilize native transthyretin tetramers with drugs like tafamadis or diflunisal to prevent the dissociation of monomeric components \(e\.g\.\, from mutant isoforms\) that can then misfold into amyloid fibrils\.__

__With these approaches\, coupled with earlier detection of amyloid deposits before irreversible damage is done\, what previously has been an intractable and inexorable process may eventually become manageable\.__
