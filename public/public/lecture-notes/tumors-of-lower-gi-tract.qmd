# Tumors of Lower GI Tract

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Polyps

* __Most common in the colon__
* __May occur in the esophagus\, stomach\, or small intestine__
* __Most common neoplastic polyp is the adenoma__
* __Non\-neoplastic colonic polyps__
  * __inflammatory\, hamartomatous\, hyperplastic__

__Those without stalks are referred to as sessile__

__As sessile polyps enlarge\, proliferation of cells adjacent to the polyp and the effects of traction on the luminal protrusion\, may combine to create a stalk__

__Polyps with stalks are termed pedunculated__

# Inflammatory Polyps

* __Chronic cycles of injury and healing produce a polypoid mass made up of inflamed and reactive mucosal tissue__
* __Polyp that forms as part of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome__
  * __Clinical triad of rectal bleeding\, mucus discharge\, and an inflammatory lesion of the anterior rectal wall__
  * __Impaired relaxation of the anorectal sphincter__

# Hamartomatous Polyps

__Occur sporadically__

__Components of various genetically determined or acquired syndromes__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Juvenile Polyps

* __Most common type of hamartomatous polyp__
* __Children <5 years of age__
* __Located in the rectum__
* __Rectal bleeding\, prolapse__
* __Sporadic juvenile polyps are usually solitary__
* __Autosomal dominant syndrome of juvenile polyposis 3\-100 polyps__
* __Colectomy may be required__
* __Dysplasia occurs in a small proportion \(mostly syndrome\-associated\)__
  * __Juvenile polyposis syndrome is associated with increased risk for the development of colonic adenocarcinoma__
* __Mucosal hyperplasia\, transforming growth factor\-β \(TGF\-β\)__

__Pedunculated\, smooth\-surfaced\, reddish lesions__

__<3 cm__

__Cystic spaces on cut sections__

__Dilated glands filled with mucin and inflammatory debris__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome

__Rare autosomal dominant disorder__

__Presence of multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation__

__Increased risk of several malignancies\, colon\, pancreas\, breast\, lung\, ovaries\, uterus\, and testes__

__Germ line heterozygous loss\-of\-function mutations in the gene LKB1/STK11 are present in approximately half of the patients with the familial and subset of sporadic form__

__Intestinal polyps are most common in the small intestine\, may also occur in the stomach and colon\, rarely\, in the bladder and lungs__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract11.png)

__Large and pedunculated__

__Lobulated contour__

__Arborizing network of connective tissue\, smooth muscle\, lamina propria\, and glands lined by normal\-appearing intestinal epithelium__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract12.png)

__Peutz\-Jeghers polyp\. Complex glandular architecture and bundles of smooth muscle help to distinguish Peutz\-Jeghers polyps from juvenile polyps\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Hyperplastic Polyps

__Common epithelial proliferations__

__Sixth and seventh decades of life__

__Decreased epithelial cell turnover and delayed shedding of surface epithelial cells\, leading to a “pileup” of goblet cells__

__No malignant potential\, must be distinguished from sessile serrated adenomas__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract13.png)

__Most commonly found in the left colon__

__Less than 5 mm in diameter__

__Smooth\, nodular protrusions of the mucosa__

__Frequently multiple\, in the sigmoid colon and rectum__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Polyp surface with irregular tufting of epithelial cells__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract15.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Tufting results from epithelial overcrowding__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract16.png)

__Epithelial crowding produces a serrated architecture when glands are cut in cross\-section__

# Adenoma

__Neoplastic mass lesion in the GI tract__

__Produce a mucosal protrusion\, or polyp__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Epithelial dysplasia__

__Small\, often pedunculated polyps to large sessile lesions__

__No gender predilection__

__50% of adults living in the Western world beginning age 50__

__Precursors to colorectal cancer__

__Surveillance colonoscopy__

__Tubular adenoma with a smooth surface and rounded glands__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract20.jpg)

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract21.png)

__Villous adenoma with long\, slender projections that are reminiscent of small intestinal villi__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract22.png)

__The cytologic hallmark of epithelial dysplasia is nuclear hyperchromasia\, elongation\, and stratification__

__Changes are most easily appreciated at the surface of the adenoma\, because the epithelium fails to mature as cells migrate out of the crypt__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract23.png)

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract24.png)

__Sessile serrated adenoma__

__Lined by goblet cells without typical cytologic features of dysplasia\. This lesion is distinguished from a hyperplastic polyp by involvement of the crypts__

__Most common in the right colon__

__Have a malignant potential similar to that of traditional adenomas__

* __Colon cancers tend to occur at younger ages than for sporadic colon cancers and often are located in the right colon__
* __Inherited germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes__
  * __MSH2 or MLH1__
  * __HNPCC inherit one mutated DNA repair gene and one normal allele__
  * __When the second copy is lost through mutation or epigenetic silencing\, defects in mismatch repair lead to the accumulation of mutations at rates up to 1000 times higher than normal__
  * __Regions containing short repeating DNA sequences referred to as microsatellite DNA__

# Adenocarcinoma of Colon

* __Most common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract__
* __Major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide__
* __Small intestine\, which accounts for 75% of the overall length of the gastrointestinal tract\, is an uncommon site for benign and malignant tumors\. Nearly 15% of all cancer\-related deaths\, second only to lung cancer__
* __Incidence__
  * __Peaks at 60 to 70 years of age\, and less than 20% of cases occur before age 50__
  * __Males are affected slightly more often than females__
  * __Most prevalent in the United States\, Canada\, Australia\, New Zealand\, Denmark\, Sweden\, and other developed countries__
  * __30x lower in India\, South America\, and Africa__
  * __Japan incidence is increasing__
* __Low intake of unabsorbable vegetable fiber and high intake of refined carbohydrates and fat__
* __NSAID may have a protective effect__

# The APC/β-catenin pathway

__The classic adenoma\-carcinoma sequence__

__80% of sporadic colon tumors__

__Involves mutation of the APC tumor suppressor early in the neoplastic process__

__Both copies of the APC gene must be functionally inactivated\, either by mutation or epigenetic events\, for adenomas to develop__

__No APC is present__

__β\-Catenin is active independent of WNT status__

__WNT signal inhibits APC__

__β\-Catenin enters nucleus__

__APC is active__

__β\-Catenin is dectructed__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__β\-Catenin is active in the nucleus__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract33.png)

__cyclin D1 and MYC transcribed for proliferation__

__TWIST and SLUG are expressed__

__They repress E\-cadherin expression__

__Reduce contact inhibition__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__TP53 ?? 70% to 80% of colon cancers but is uncommonly affected in adenomas__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract34.png)

__KRAS__

__10% in <1cm__

__50% >1cm__

__50% in adenocarcinoma__

__SMAD2 and SMAD4\, which are effectors of TGF\-β signaling\, normally inhibits cell cycle __

__Loss of function TP53 and others caused by chromosomal deletions\, chromosomal instability in this pathway__

__Epigenetics__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# The microsatellite instability pathway

__DNA mismatch repair deficiency__

__Due to loss of mismatch repair genes__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract36.png)

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract37.png)

* __Mutations accumulate in microsatellite repeats → microsatellite instability__
  * __Microsatellites typically are located in noncoding regions__
  * __Microsatellite sequences located in the coding or promoter regions of genes involved in regulation of cell growth__
    * __type II TGF\-β receptor\, uncontrolled growth__
    * __pro\-apoptotic protein BAX\, survival of abnormal clones__

![](./img-local/Tumors-of-Lower-GI-Tract38.png)

__Mutations in the oncogene BRAF and silencing of distinct groups of genes due to CpG island hypermethylation also are common in cancers that develop through DNA mismatch repair defects\.__

__KRAS and TP53 typically are not mutated\.__
