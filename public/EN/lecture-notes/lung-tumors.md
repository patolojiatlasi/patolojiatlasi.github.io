# PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS

# Primary Lung Tumors

- **95% of primary lung tumors are carcinomas**
- **5% →**
  - **Carcinoids**
  - **Mesenchymal malignancies, fibrosarcomas, leiomyomas**
  - **Lymphomas**
  - **Other benign lesions**

# Pulmonary Hamartoma

- **Most common benign tumor**
  - **Spherical**
  - **Small (3 to 4 cm)**
  - **Coin lesion on chest radiographs**
  - **Mature cartilage, often admixed with fat, fibrous tissue, and
    blood vessels**
  - **Clonal cytogenic abnormalities show that it is a benign neoplasm**
    - **Misnomer as hamartoma**

# Lung cancer

- **Carcinoma of the lung**
- **Single most important cause of cancer-related deaths in
  industrialized countries**
  - **Incidence among males is gradually decreasing, but it continues to
    increase among females**
  - **Women dying each year from lung cancer than from breast cancers**
  - **Causal relationship of cigarette smoking and lung cancer**
- **Peak incidence in 50s-60s**
- **\>50% of patients already have distant metastatic disease**
  - **1/4 have disease in the regional lymph nodes**
- **5-yr survival rate for all stages 16%**
  - **Even localized to lung 45%**

# Smoking-related carcinomas

- **Stepwise accumulation of a multitude of genetic abnormalities**
- **Sequence of molecular changes is not random**
  - **Follows a predictable sequence that parallels the histologic
    progression**
- **Early**
  - **Inactivation of the putative tumor suppressor genes on (3p)**
  - **Found in benign bronchial epithelium of persons with lung cancer**
  - **In the respiratory epithelium of smokers without lung cancer**
  - **Field effect **
- **Late**
  - **TP53 mutations or activation of the KRAS oncogene**

# Nonsmoking women of Far Eastern origin

**Activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)**

**Sensitive to agents that inhibit EGFR signaling**

# Smoking

**90% of lung cancers occur in active smokers or those who stopped
recently**

**Linear correlation has been recognized between the frequency of lung
cancer and pack-years of cigarette smoking**

**60x greater among habitual heavy smokers (two packs a day for 20
years) than among nonsmokers**

- **Only 11% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer**
  - **Other predisposing factors must be operative in the pathogenesis
    of this deadly disease**
- **Mutagenic effect of carcinogens is conditioned by hereditary
  (genetic) factors**
  - **P-450 monooxygenase enzyme system**
- **Women have a higher susceptibility to carcinogens in tobacco than
  men**
- **Cessation of smoking decreases the risk of developing lung cancer
  over time**
  - **May never return to baseline levels**
  - **Genetic changes can persist for many years**
- **Passive smoking**
  - **2x risk than nonsmokers**
- **Pipes and cigars also increases the risk**
- **Miners**
  - **Radioactive ores**
  - **Asbestos workers**
  - **Dusts containing arsenic, chromium, uranium, nickel, vinyl
    chloride, and mustard gas**
- **Exposure to asbestos**
  - **5x risk in nonsmokers**
  - **55x risk in smokers**

  - **metastasised at the time of diagnosis**
  - **no surgery**
  - **chemotherapy w/wo radiotherapy **

the right main-stem bronchus. Metastatic tumor deposits are evident in
both lungs**
