# Chronic Interstitial Lung Diseases

**Chronic Interstitial (Restrictive, Infiltrative) Lung Diseases**

**Heterogeneous group of disorders**

**Bilateral, often patchy, usually chronic**

**Involvement of the pulmonary connective tissue**

**Most peripheral and delicate interstitium in the alveolar walls**

- **Reduced compliance**
  - **More pressure is required to expand the lungs**
  - **They are stiff**
- **Increased effort of breathing (dyspnea)**
- **Abnormalities in the ventilation–perfusion ratio → Hypoxia**
- **Respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale**
- **Advanced forms**
  - **Scarring and gross destruction of the lung**
  - **End-stage or “honeycomb” lung**

# Asbestos

**Concentration, size, shape, and solubility of the different forms of
asbestos affect pathogenesis**

**Two distinct forms of asbestos**

**Serpentine**

**Amphibole**

**Both are pathogenic for all diseases**

# Serpentine

**Fiber is curly and flexible**

**Serpentine chrysotile accounts for most of the asbestos used in
industry**

**Impacted in the upper respiratory passages and removed by the
mucociliary elevator**

**Those that are trapped in the lungs are gradually leached from the
tissues, because they are more soluble than amphiboles **

# Amphibole

**Fiber is straight, stiff, and brittle**

**More pathogenic than the serpentine chrysotile**

**Align themselves in the airstream → delivered deeper into the lungs →
penetrate epithelial cells to reach the interstitium**

# Both forms cause disease

- **Increasing exposure to either form**
  - **associated with a higher incidence of all asbestos-related
    diseases**
- **Interaction of particulates with lung macrophages → fibrosis**
- **Functions as both a tumor initiator and a promoter**
  - **Reactive free radicals generated by asbestos fibers → mesothelial
    tumors**
  - **Potentially toxic chemicals adsorbed onto the asbestos fibers**
    - **Tobacco smoking**

# Asbestosis

**Diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis**

**Indistinguishable from UIP**

**Except for the presence of asbestos bodies**

# Asbestos Bodies

- **Golden brown, fusiform or beaded rods with a translucent center**
- **Coated with an iron-containing proteinaceous material**
- **Formed when macrophages attempt to phagocytose asbestos fibers**
  - **The iron is derived from phagocyte ferritin**
- **Can be found in the lungs of normal persons**
  - **Much lower concentrations and without an accompanying interstitial
    fibrosis.**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Interstitial-Lung-Diseases25.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Asbestosis

- **Begins in the lower lobes and subpleurally**
  - **In contrast with CWP and silicosis**
- **Middle and upper lobes of the lungs become affected as fibrosis
  progresses**
- **Contraction of the fibrous tissue**
  - **Distorts the normal architecture**
  - **Creating enlarged air spaces enclosed within thick fibrous walls**
  - **Affected regions become honeycombed**
- **Fibrosis develops in the visceral pleura**
  - **Adhesions between the lungs and the chest wall**
- **Scarring trap and narrow pulmonary arteries and arterioles**
  - **Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Interstitial-Lung-Diseases26.png)

**Asbestosis**

**Markedly thickened visceral pleura covers the lateral and
diaphragmatic surface**

**Severe interstitial fibrosis diffusely affecting the lower lobe**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Interstitial-Lung-Diseases27.png)

# Pleural plaques

**Most common manifestation of asbestos exposure**

**Well-circumscribed plaques of dense collagen**

**Often contain calcium**

**Most frequently on the anterior and posterolateral aspects of the
parietal pleura and over the domes of the diaphragm**

**Do not contain asbestos bodies**

**Rarely occur in persons with no history or evidence of asbestos
exposure **

**Uncommonly, asbestos exposure induces pleural effusion or diffuse
pleural fibrosis.**

# Asbestosis

**End stage lung and heart diseases**

**The risk of lung carcinoma is increased 5x**

**Mesothelioma risk 1000x**

carcinoma but not that of mesothelioma**
