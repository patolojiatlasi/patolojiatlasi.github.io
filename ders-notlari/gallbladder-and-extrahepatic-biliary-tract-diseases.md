## Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)

- **10-20% of adults in Western countries in the Northern Hemisphere**
- **20-40% in Latin American countries**
- **3-4% in Asian countries**
- **Cholesterol stones**
  - **Containing crystalline cholesterol monohydrate**
  - **80% of stones in the West**
- **Pigment stones**
  - **Made of bilirubin calcium salts**
- **Bile formation**
  - **Only significant pathway for elimination of excess cholesterol
    from the body**
  - **Either as free cholesterol or as bile salts**
- **Cholesterol**
  - **Water-soluble by aggregation with bile salts and lecithins**
  - **Concentrations exceed the solubilizing capacity of bile
    (supersaturation)**
  - **Remain dispersed and crystallizes out of solution**

![](./img-local/Gallbladder-and-Extrahepatic-Biliary-Tract-Diseases4.png)

- **Gallstone formation**
  - **Enhanced by hypomobility of the gallbladder (stasis)**
  - **Promotes nucleation**
  - **Mucus hypersecretion**
  - **Consequent trapping of the crystals**
  - **Aggregation into stones**
- **Precipitates are primarily insoluble calcium bilirubinate salts**

## Risk Factors for Cholelithiasis

- **80% no identifiable risk factors other than age and gender**
- **Prevalence increases throughout life**
- **F:M = 2:1**
- **50-75% in certain Native American populations**
  - **Related to biliary cholesterol hypersecretion**
- **Positive family history increases risk**
  - **Errors of metabolism, impaired bile salt synthesis and secretion**
- **Estrogenic influences**
  - **Oral contraceptives and pregnancy, increase hepatic cholesterol
    uptake and synthesis**
- **Obesity, rapid weight loss, hypocholesterolemic agent clofibrate**
  - **Increased biliary cholesterol secretion**
- **Gallbladder motility is reduced**
  - **Pregnancy, rapid weight loss, spinal cord injury**
  - **Without obvious cause**

## Cholesterol stones

**Most common in gallbladder**

**50-100% cholesterol**

**Pale**

**Increasing proportions of calcium carbonate, phosphates, and bilirubin
impart gray-white to black discoloration**

**Ovoid and firm**

**Can occur singly**

**Several, with faceted surfaces resulting from their apposition**

**Most radiolucent, 20% sufficient calcium carbonate to be radiopaque**

## Pigment stones

- **Anywhere in the biliary tree**
- **Lesser amounts of other calcium salts, mucin glycoproteins, and
  cholesterol**
- **Hemolytic anemias and infections of the biliary tract**
- **Black stones**
  - **Sterile gallbladder bile**
  - **Small in size, fragile to the touch, and numerous**
  - **50% to 75% of black stones are radiopaque**
    - **calcium carbonates and phosphates**
- **Brown stones**
  - **Infected intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts**
  - **Single or few in number**
  - **Soft, greasy, soaplike consistency**
    - **retained fatty acid salts released by the action of bacterial
      phospholipases on biliary lecithins**
  - **Radiolucent**
    - **calcium soaps**

## Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)

- **70-80% asymptomatic throughout life**
- **pain, often excruciating**
  - **right upper quadrant or epigastric region**
  - **constant or, less commonly, spasmodic**
  - **“biliary” pain is caused by gallbladder or biliary tree
    obstruction, or by inflammation of the gallbladder itself**
- **empyema, perforation, fistulas, inflammation of the biliary tree,
  and obstructive cholestasis or pancreatitis**
- **The larger the calculi, the less likely they are to enter the cystic
  or common ducts to produce obstruction**
  - **small stones, or “gravel,” are more dangerous**
  - **A large stone may erode directly into an adjacent loop of small
    bowel, generating intestinal obstruction ( gallstone ileus )**

## Cholecystitis

- **Inflammation of the gallbladder**
- **Acute, chronic, or acute superimposed on chronic**
- **Almost always occurs in association with gallstones**
  - **epidemiologic distribution closely parallels that of gallstones**

## Acute cholecystitis

- **Gallbladder usually is enlarged and tense**
- **A bright red or blotchy, violaceous color**
  - **subserosal hemorrhages**
- **Frequently covered by a fibrinous, fibrinopurulent exudate**
- **90% of cases, stones are present**
  - **obstructing the neck of the gallbladder or the cystic duct**
- **Lumen**
  - **filled with cloudy or turbid bile**
  - **contain fibrin, blood, and frank pus**
  - **exudate is mostly pus**
    - **empyema of the gallbladder**
- **Wall**
  - **thickened, edematous, and hyperemic**
  - **green-black necrotic **
    - **gangrenous cholecystitis**
- **Histologic examination:**
  - **Edema**
  - **Leukocytic infiltration**
  - **Vascular congestion**
  - **Frank abscess formation**
  - **Gangrenous necrosis**

## Acute Calculous Cholecystitis

**Acute inflammation of a gallbladder with stones**

**Obstruction of the gallbladder neck or cystic duct**

**Most common major complication of gallstones**

**Most common reason for emergency cholecystectomy**

- **Chemical irritation and inflammation of the gallbladder wall**

- **Phospholipases derived from the mucosa**

  - **hydrolyzes biliary lecithin to lysolecithin**
  - **toxic to the mucosa**

- **Protective glycoprotein mucous layer is disrupted**

  - **mucosal epithelium direct contact with detergent action of bile
    salts**

- **Prostaglandins released within wall of the distended gallbladder**

  - **contribute to mucosal and mural inflammation**

- **Distention and increased intraluminal pressure**

  - **compromise blood flow to the mucosa**

- **Later bacterial contamination may develop**

- **5-12% contain no gallstones**

- **occur in seriously ill patients**

  - **Major, nonbiliary surgery**
  - **Severe trauma (e.g., from motor vehicle crashes)**
  - **Severe burns**
  - **Sepsis**

- **Dehydration, gallbladder stasis and sludging, vascular compromise,
  bacterial contamination**

## Chronic Cholecystitis

**Changes are sometimes subtle**

**Presence of stones within the gallbladder**

**Absence of acute inflammation**

**Contracted, of normal size, or enlarged**

**Mucosal ulcerations are infrequent**

**Submucosa and subserosa often are thickened from fibrosis**

**mural lymphocytes**

- **sequel to repeated bouts of acute cholecystitis**
- **without any history of acute attacks**
- **Almost always associated with gallstones**
  - **gallstones do not seem to have a direct role in the initiation of
    inflammation or the development of pain**
  - **chronic acalculous cholecystitis causes symptoms and morphologic
    alterations similar to those seen in the calculous form**
- **Supersaturation of bile**
  - **chronic inflammation**
  - **stone formation**
- **Microorganisms**
  - **E.coli and enterococci**
  - **cultured from the bile in only about one third of cases**
- **Complications:**
  - **Bacterial superinfection with cholangitis or sepsis**
  - **Gallbladder perforation and local abscess formation**
  - **Gallbladder rupture with diffuse peritonitis**
  - **Biliary enteric (cholecystenteric) fistula**
    - **drainage of bile into adjacent organs**
    - **entry of air and bacteria into the biliary tree**
    - **gallstone-induced intestinal obstruction (ileus)**
  - **Aggravation of preexisting medical illness**
    - **cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or liver decompensation**

## DISORDERS OF EXTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCTS

## Choledocholithiasis

- **Choledocholithiasis and Cholangitis frequently occur together**
- **Choledocholithiasis**
  - **presence of stones within the biliary tree**
  - **Western nations, almost all stones are derived from the
    gallbladder**
  - **Asia, much higher incidence of primary ductal and intrahepatic,
    pigmented, stone**
  - **may not immediately obstruct major bile ducts**
  - **asymptomatic stones are found in about 10% of patients at the time
    of surgical cholecystectomy**

**Symptoms may occur:**

**Biliary obstruction**

**Cholangitis**

**Hepatic abscess**

**Chronic liver disease with secondary biliary cirrhosis**

**Acute calculous cholecystitis**

## Cholangitis

- **Acute inflammation of the wall of bile ducts**

- **Almost always caused by bacterial infection of the normally sterile
  lumen**

- **Result from any lesion obstructing bile flow**

  - **most commonly choledocholithiasis**
  - **surgery involving the biliary tree**
  - **Tumors**
  - **indwelling stents or catheters**
  - **acute pancreatitis**
  - **benign strictures**

- **May lead to cholestasis and more importantly sepsis**

- **Ascending cholangitis**

  - **Bacteria enter the biliary tract through the sphincter of Oddi**
  - **once within the biliary tree, infection goes to intrahepatic
    biliary ducts**
  - **E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococci, Clostridium, and Bacteroides**
  - **Two or more organisms are found in half of the cases**

- **Parasitic cholangitis**

  - **Fasciola hepatica or schistosomiasis in Latin America and the Near
    East**
  - **Clonorchis sinensis or Opisthorchis viverrini in the Far East**
  - **Cryptosporidiosis in persons with AIDS**

- **Suppurative cholangitis**

  - **purulent bile fills and distends bile ducts**
  - **risk of liver abscess formation**

## Secondary Biliary Cirrhosis

- **Prolonged obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree may cause
  damage to the liver**
  - **Extrahepatic cholelithiasis**
    - **most common cause**
  - **Biliary atresia**
  - **Malignancies of the biliary tree and head of the pancreas**
  - **Strictures resulting from previous surgical procedures**
- **Initially → cholestasis**
  - **entirely reversible with correction of the obstruction**
- **Secondary inflammation → initiates periportal fibrogenesis**
  - **leads to scarring and nodule formation**
  - **generating secondary biliary cirrhosis**

## Biliary Atresia

**Major cause of neonatal cholestasis**

**One third of the cases of cholestasis in infants**

**1 in 10,000 live births**

**Complete obstruction of bile flow**

**destruction or absence of all or part of the extrahepatic bile ducts**

**most frequent cause of death from liver disease in early childhood**

**more than half of the referrals of children for liver
transplantation**

## Features of biliary atresia

- **Inflammation and fibrosing stricture of the hepatic or common bile
  ducts**
- **Inflammation of major intrahepatic bile ducts, with progressive
  destruction of the intrahepatic biliary tree**
- **Florid features of biliary obstruction on liver biopsy**
  - **ductular reaction, portal tract edema and fibrosis, and
    parenchymal cholestasis**
- **Periportal fibrosis and cirrhosis within 3 to 6 months of birth**

## TUMORS

## Carcinoma of the Gallbladder

- **Most frequent malignant tumor of the biliary tract**

- **2-6x common in women**

- **Most frequently in the seventh decade of life**

- **More frequent in the populations of Mexico and Chile**

  - **higher incidence of gallstone disease in these regions**

- **Rarely is it discovered at a resectable stage**

- **Mean 5-year survival rate is 5%**

- **Gallstones present in 60-90% of cases**

- **In Asia, where pyogenic and parasitic diseases of the biliary tree
  are more common, gallstones are less important**

- **Gallbladders containing stones or infectious agents develop cancer
  as a result of recurrent trauma and chronic inflammation**

- **The role of carcinogenic derivatives of bile acids is unclear**

- **Infiltrating growth patterns**

  - **more common**
  - **poorly defined area of diffuse thickening**
  - **induration of the gallbladder wall**
  - **may cover several square centimeters or involve the entire
    gallbladder**
  - **scirrhous and very firm**

- **Exophytic growth pattern**

  - **grows into the lumen as an irregular, cauliflower-like mass but at
    the same time also invades the underlying wall**

- **Adenocarcinomas**

  - **papillary or poorly differentiated**

- **5% are squamous cell carcinomas or demonstrate adenosquamous
  differentiation**

- **Rare neuroendocrine tumors**

- **By the time gallbladder cancers are discovered, most have invaded
  the liver or have spread to the bile ducts or to the portal hepatic
  lymph nodes**

- **Preoperative diagnosis \<20%**

## Cholangiocarcinomas

- **Adenocarcinomas**
- **Arise from cholangiocytes lining the intrahepatic and extrahepatic
  biliary ducts**
- **Papillary or flat precursor lesions**
- **Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas**
- **2/3 of cholangiocarcinomas**
- **Develop at the hilum**
  - **Klatskin tumors**
- **More distally in the biliary tree**
- **50-70 years of age**

**Both intra- and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas generally are
asymptomatic until they reach an advanced stage**

**Prognosis is poor**

**Most patients have unresectable tumors**

- **Risk factors include chronic cholestasis and inflammation**
  - **Primary sclerosing cholangitis**
  - **Fibropolycystic diseases of the biliary tree**
  - **Infestation by Clonorchis sinensis or Opisthorchis viverrini**
- **Activating mutations in the KRAS and BRAF oncogenes and
  loss-of-function mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene**

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Diseases**

- **Extrahepatic biliary tumors tend to be relatively small at the time
  of diagnosis**
  - **cause obstruction and symptoms**
- **Intrahepatic tumors may cause symptoms only when much of the liver
  is replaced by tumor**
- **Spread to extrahepatic sites**
  - **regional lymph nodes, lungs, bones, and adrenal glands**
  - **Invasion along peribiliary nerves to spread to the abdomen**
- **Cholangiocarcinoma has a greater propensity for extrahepatic spread
  than does hepatocellular carcinoma**
