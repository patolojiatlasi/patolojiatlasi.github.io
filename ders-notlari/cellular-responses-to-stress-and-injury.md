## Pathologic hypertrophy

**Atlas of Autopsy Pathology, 2** **nd** \_\_ ed. Figure 15-33 Left
ventricular hypertrophy. The short-axis plane of section shows the
cavities and entire circumference of the ventricular walls to good
advantage. In this patient with hypertension, the left ventricular
cavity is small because of concentric hypertrophy of the walls and
papillary muscles.\_\_

**Atlas of Autopsy Pathology, 2** **nd** \_\_ ed. \_\_ **Figure 15-34**
**   Right ventricular hypertrophy. These short-axis cuts of the heart
from an adult with a congenital ventricular septal defect show the right
ventricular hypertrophy and marked cavity dilation that are associated
with long-standing pulmonary hypertension. In the normal heart, the
right ventricular apex does not quite reach the apex of the heart, so in
this specimen the apical cut (top) is particularly revealing. The left
ventricle is relatively normal. ** *RV,* \_\_ Right ventricle; \_\_
*LV,* \_\_ left ventricle. \_\_

**Atlas of Autopsy Pathology, 2** **nd** \_\_ ed. \_\_ **Figure 15-35**
**   Concentric and eccentric hypertrophy. The difference between
concentric hypertrophy and eccentric hypertrophy is illustrated in these
two short-axis cuts from two different hearts of approximately the same
weight (** *left,* \_\_ 575 g; \_\_ *right,* \_\_ 600 g). In the
specimen on the left, the left ventricular cavity \_\_ *(LV)* \_\_ is
dilated and the walls appear nearly normal in thickness. In contrast,
the heart on the right has very thick left ventricular walls that
diminish the cavity. Both specimens showed histopathologic features of
hypertrophy. \_\_

**Atlas of Autopsy Pathology, 2** **nd** \_\_ ed. \_\_ **Figure 15-37**
**   Right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation. Normally, the right
ventricular apex does not quite reach the apex of the heart. This apical
cut of a heart from a patient with chronic liver disease shows the right
ventricular cavity, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. **

## Mechanisms of Cardiac Hypertrophy

- **mechanical triggers**
  - **Stretch**
  - **increase in the amount of blood volume**
  - **Push blood to a resistant channel**
- **trophic triggers**
  - **Growth factors**
  - **Adrenergic hormones**

**mechanical triggers**

**trophic triggers**

**Induction of genes**

**Production of proteins**

**more proteins and myofilaments per cell**

**more proteins and myofilaments per cell**

**increases the force generated with each contraction**

**meet increased work demands**

**So, we are happy**

## Mechanisms of Cardiac HypertrophyThings start to change

**switch of contractile proteins from adult to fetal or neonatal forms**

**α-myosin heavy chain is replaced by the β form of the myosin heavy
chain, which produces slower, more energetically economical
contraction**

- **Then it reaches the limit**
- **Muscle mass cannot compansate the burden**
- **Large proteins are likely to pump less effectively**
- **Degenerative changes start**
  - **Fragmantation**
  - **Loss of fibrillary elements**

**Maybe the vessels are not enough**

**Mitochondria cannot supply ATP properly**

**The synthesis of new proteins are not effective **

## Mechanisms of Cardiac HypertrophyEnd up with

**Huge, dilated**

**So called “bovine hearth”**

**Cannot pump enough**

**Even cannot pump enough to supply itself**

**Cell injury**

**A vicious circle**

## Adaptations

**Hypertrophy**

<span style="color:##FF0000">Hyperplasia</span>

**Atrophy**

**Metaplasia**

## Hyperplasia

**increase in cell number**

**adaptive response in cells capable of replication**

**Hypertrophy and hyperplasia can occur together**

## Physiologic hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the uterus during pregnancy

## physiologic hyperplasia

**Hormonal Hyperplasia**

**Compensatory hyperplasia**

**Female breast**

**Puberty, pregnancy**

**proliferation of the glandular epithelium**

**Residual tissue growth**

**After removal or partial loss of organ**

**Liver**

![](./img-local/Cellular-Responses-to-Stress-and-Injury13.jpg)

## Compensatory Hyperplasia of Liver

**One can donate part of liver when (s)he is alive**

**Mitosis starts 12 hours later**

**Restore liver to original weight**

**Then proliferation stops**

## Examples of pathologic hyperplasia

- **Endometrial hyperplasia**
  - **Disturbance of the hormonal balance in favor of estrogen over
    progesterone**

## Hyperplasia in wound healing

**Fibroblasts, blood vessels proliferate**

**Local effect of mediators from leukocytes**

## Hyperplasia in viral infection

- **Papillomaviruses **
  - **cause skin warts and mucosal lesions**
  - \_\_ masses of hyperplastic epithelium. \_\_
- **Growth factors may be encoded by viral or infected host cell
  genes.**

## Hyperplasia

**The hyperplastic process remains controlled; if the signals that
initiate it abate, the hyperplasia disappears**

**In cancer, in which the growth control mechanisms become dysregulated
or ineffective in many cases**

**Pathologic hyperplasia constitutes a fertile soil in which cancers may
eventually arise**

## Hypertrophy vs Hyperplasia

**Hypertrophy**

**Hyperplasia**

*increase in the size of cells*

*increase in the size of the organ*

**no new cells, just bigger cells**

**increased amount of structural proteins and organelles**

**when cells are incapable of dividing**

- **increase in cell number**
- **adaptive response in cells capable of replication**
  - **(remember G0,G1,S,M phases of mitosis)**

## Adaptations

**Hypertrophy**

**Hyperplasia**

<span style="color:##FF0000">Atrophy</span>

**Metaplasia**

## Atrophy

**Shrinkage in the size of the cell**

**by the loss of cell substance**

**After many cells become atrophic tissue and organs become atrophic**

**Cells decrease function, not dead**

**Normal brain of a young adult**

![](./img-local/Cellular-Responses-to-Stress-and-Injury15.jpg)

**an 82-year-old man with atherosclerotic disease.**

**Atrophy of the brain is due to aging and reduced blood supply**

## Causes of atrophy

- **decreased workload**
  - **immobilization of a limb after fracture**
- **loss of innervation**
- **diminished blood supply**
- **inadequate nutrition**
- **loss of endocrine stimulation**
- **aging (senile atrophy)**

## 

**Physiologic atrophy**

**Pathologic atrophy**

- **Decrease in size of uterus**
  - **Decrease hormones after menopouse**

**Denervation atrophy**

**Cellular changes are same**

**Cells get smaller until a point where survival is still possible**

## Mechanism of atrophy

**Decreased protein synthesis**

**Increased protein loss**

**Reduced metabolic activity**

**ubiquitin-proteasome pathway**

**Nutrient deficiency and disuse activate process**

**Increased catabolism**

## Adaptations

**Hypertrophy**

**Hyperplasia**

**Atrophy**

<span style="color:##FF0000">Metaplasia</span>

## Metaplasia

- **reversible change**
- **one adult cell type**
  - **epithelial or mesenchymal)**
- **replaced by another adult cell type**

## Question to think aboutWhich one is pathologic?

**Hormonal Hyperplasia**

**Hormonal hyperplasia**

**Female breast**

**Increased prolactin in circulation**

**Puberty, pregnancy**

**proliferation of the glandular epithelium**

**Male breast**

**Increased prolactin in circulation**

**Reason is usually prolactin secreting pituitary tumor**

**Acini are not present in male breast. Ductules and stroma is
affected.**

## Question to thinkWhich one is pathologic inCompensatory Hyperplasia of Liver

**Hyperplasia after donation**

**Regenerative nodules in cirrhosis**

**One can donate part of liver when (s)he is alive**

**Mitosis starts 12 hours later**

**Restore liver to original weight**

**Then proliferation stops**

**3D architecture is preserved**

**After cirrhosis occurs**

**Functional liver cells required**

**Liver cells are capable of dividing**

**They start to divide to compansate**

**Cannot reform the 3D architecture of liver**

## Question to think aboutDoes brain gets hyperplastic/hypertophic changes?

**No**

**Yes**

**With ongoing learning stimuli new connections are being made**

**Brain has ability to plasticize**

**Nerve cells are stabile**

**They do not proliferate**

**They do not increase in size**
