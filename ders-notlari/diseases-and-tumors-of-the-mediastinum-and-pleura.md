## Diseases and Tumors of the Mediastinum and Pleura

## Serdar BALCI, MD

## Pleural Lesions

**Primary intrapleural bacterial infections**

**Primary neoplasm, malignant mesothelioma**

**A secondary complication of an underlying pulmonary disease**

## Pleural Effusion and Pleuritis

- **Pleural effusion**
- **Presence of fluid in the pleural space**
- **Transudate → hydrothorax**
  - **CHF most common cause**
- **Exudate**
  - **protein content greater than 2.9gm/dL**
  - **inflammatory cells**
  - **pleuritis**

## Causes of pleural exudate

- **Microbial invasion through either direct extension of a pulmonary
  infection or blood-borne seeding**
  - **suppurative pleuritis or empyema**
- **Cancer **
  - **lung carcinoma, metastatic neoplasms to the lung or pleural
    surface, mesothelioma**
  - **malignant effusion**
  - **bloody, hemorrhagic pleuritis**
- **Pulmonary infarction**
- **Viral pleuritis**
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and uremia**
- **Previous thoracic surgery**

**Suppurative pleuritis**

**Empyema**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

## Pleural effusions

- **Transudates and serous exudates**
  - **Resorbed without residual effects**
- **Fibrinous, hemorrhagic, and suppurative exudates **
  - **Organization, adhesions, fibrous pleural thickening, massive
    calcifications**

## Pneumothorax

- **Presence of air or other gas in the pleural sac**
- **Simple or spontaneous pneumothorax**
  - **Young, healthy adults, men without any known pulmonary disease**
- **Secondary pneumothorax**
  - **Thoracic or lung disorder, emphysema, fractured rib**
  - **Inspired air goes to pleural cavity**
    - **Emphysema, lung abscess, tuberculosis, carcinoma**
    - **Mechanical ventilatory support with high pressure**

## Complications of pneumothorax

- **Tension pneumothorax**
  - **Leak- valve**
  - **Shifts the mediastinum**
  - **Compromise pulmonary circulation**
  - **May be fatal**
  - **Leak seals but lung is not reexpanded within a few weeks**
    - **Spontaneously or medical or surgical intervention**
    - **Scarring may occur, never fully reexpand**
  - **Serous fluid collects → hydropneumothorax**
    - **Vulnerable to infection**
    - **Empyema → pyopneumothorax**

## Hemothorax

**Collection of whole blood**

**Ruptured intrathoracic aortic aneurysm**

**In contrast with bloody pleural effusions, the blood clots within the
pleural cavity**

## Chylothorax

- **Milky lymphatic fluid containing microglobules of lipid**
- **Always significant**
- **Obstruction of the major lymph ducts**
  - **intrathoracic cancer**

## Malignant Mesothelioma

**Cancer of mesothelial cells**

**Usually arising in the parietal or visceral pleura**

**Less commonly, in the peritoneum and pericardium**

**Related to occupational exposure to asbestos in the air**

**50% of persons with this cancer have a history of exposure to
asbestos**

**Shipyard workers, miners, insulators**

**Living in proximity to an asbestos factory, a relative of an asbestos
worker**

**The latent period for developing malignant mesothelioma is long**

**25-40 years after initial asbestos exposure**

**With combination of cigarette smoking, asbestos exposure greatly
increases the risk of lung carcinoma**

- **Preceded by extensive pleural fibrosis and plaque formation**
- **Begin in a localized area and over time spread widely**
  - **contiguous growth or by diffusely seeding the pleural surfaces**
- **Lung typically is ensheathed by a yellow-white, firm, sometimes
  gelatinous layer of tumor that obliterates the pleural space**

**Malignant mesothelioma**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

![](./img-local/Diseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Mediastinum-and-Pleura6.png)

**Malignant mesothelioma**

**Thick, firm, white pleural tumor**

**Ensheathes lung**

Robbins Basic Pathology

**Distant metastases are rare**

**Directly invade the thoracic wall or the subpleural lung tissue**

## Mesothelioma patterns

- **Normal mesothelial cells are biphasic**
  - **Pleural lining cells**
  - **Underlying fibrous tissue**
- **Mesothelioma patterns**
  - **Epithelial**
    - **Cuboidal cells line tubular and microcystic spaces**
    - **Small papillary buds project**
    - **Most common pattern**
    - **Confused with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma**
  - **Sarcomatous**
    - **Spindled and sometimes fibroblastic-appearing cells**
    - **Nondistinctive sheets**
  - **Biphasic, having both sarcomatous and epithelial areas**

**Malignant mesothelioma**

**Papillary formations and desmoplastic stromal reaction. **

## Asbestos

- **Not removed**
- **Not metabolized**
- **Fibers remain in the body for life**
- **Lifetime risk after exposure does not diminish over time**
- **Asbestos fibers preferentially gather near the mesothelial cell
  layer**
- **Generate reactive oxygen species**
- **DNA damage with potentially oncogenic mutations**
  - **p16/CDKN2A, 9p21**
  - **NF2, 22q12**

## THYMOMA

## Thymoma

**Tumors of thymic epithelial cells**

**Typically also contain benign immature T cells (thymocytes)**

**Tumors that are cytologically benign and noninvasive**

**Tumors that are cytologically benign but invasive or metastatic**

**Tumors that are cytologically malignant (thymic carcinoma)**

- **\>40 years old**
- **No gender difference**
- **Localisation:**
  - **Most arise in the anterior superior mediastinum**
  - **Sometimes they occur in the neck, thyroid, pulmonary hilus, or
    elsewhere**
  - **Uncommon in the posterior mediastinum**
  - **20-30% of tumors in the anterosuperior mediastinum, which is also
    a common location for certain lymphomas**

## Clinical Presentation of Thymomas

**40% mass effect**

**30-45% myasthenia gravis**

**Others incidentally during imaging studies or cardiothoracic surgery**

## Diseases Associated with Thymoma

**Myasthenia gravis **

**Hypogammaglobulinemia**

**Pure red cell aplasia**

**Graves disease**

**Pernicious anemia**

**Dermatomyositis-polymyositis**

**Cushing syndrome**

## Autoimmune Diseases Associated with Thymoma

**Thymocytes within thymomas give rise to long-lived CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells**

**Cortical thymomas rich in thymocytes are more likely to be associated
with autoimmune disease**

**Abnormalities in the selection or “education” of T cells maturing
within the environment of the neoplasm contribute to the development of
diverse autoimmune disorders**

## Thymomas

- **Macroscopically**
  - **Lobulated**
  - **Firm**
  - **Gray-white masses**
  - **15-20 cm**
  - **Sometimes cystic necrosis and calcification**
  - **Most encapsulated**
  - **20-25% penetrate the capsule and infiltrate perithymic tissues and
    structures**

**Gross appearance of a thymoma showing distinct multinodularity. There
is focal cystic change in the larger nodule. **

## Noninvasive thymomas

**Composed of medullary-type epithelial cells**

**Mixture of medullary and cortical type epithelial cells**

**The medullary type epithelial cells are elongated or spindle-shaped**

**There is usually a sparse infiltrate of thymocytes, which often
recapitulate the phenotype of medullary thymocytes**

**Benign thymoma (medullary type):**

**Neoplastic epithelial cells in a swirling pattern and have bland, oval
to elongated nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli. Few small, reactive
lymphoid cells are interspersed.**

![](./img-local/Diseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Mediastinum-and-Pleura11.png)

## Invasive thymoma

**Tumor that is cytologically benign but locally invasive**

**Much more likely to metastasize**

**Epithelial cells are most commonly of the cortical variety, with
abundant cytoplasm and rounded vesicular nuclei, and are usually mixed
with numerous thymocytes**

**Malignant thymoma, type I. The neoplastic epithelial cells are
polygonal and have round to oval, bland nuclei with inconspicuous
nucleoli. Numerous small, reactive lymphoid cells are interspersed.**

## Thymic carcinoma

- **5% of thymomas**
- **Macroscopically**
  - **Fleshy**
  - **obviously invasive masses**
  - **accompanied by metastases, lungs**
- **Microscopically**
- **Most are squamous cell carcinomas**
- **Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma**
  - **50% contain monoclonal EBV genomes**

**Gross appearance of thymic carcinoma (type C thymoma). The tumor is
invasive and shows foci of necrosis. **
