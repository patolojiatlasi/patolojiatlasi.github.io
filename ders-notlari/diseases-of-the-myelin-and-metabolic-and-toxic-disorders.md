## Diseases of the Myelin, Metabolic and Toxic Disorders

## Serdar BALCI, MD

## PRIMARY DISEASES OF MYELIN

## Myelin

**Axons are tightly ensheathed by myelin**

**Electrical insulator that allows rapid propagation of neural
impulses**

**Consists of multiple layers of highly specialized, closely apposed
plasma membranes**

**Assembled by oligodendrocytes**

**Myelinated axons are present in all areas of the brain**

**Dominant component in the white matter**

**Diseases of myelin are primarily white matter disorders**

**Most diseases of CNS myelin do not involve the peripheral nerves to
any significant extent, and vice versa**

## Myelin in peripheral nerves

- **Differences of myelin in the CNS and PNS**
- **Peripheral myelin is made by Schwann cells, not oligodendrocytes**
- **Each Schwann cell in a peripheral nerve provides myelin for only one
  internode**
  - **in the CNS, many internodes are created by processes coming from a
    single oligodendrocyte**
- **Specialized proteins and lipids are also different**
- **Most diseases of CNS myelin do not involve the peripheral nerves to
  any significant extent, and vice versa**

## Diseases involving myelin

- **Demyelinating diseases of the CNS**
  - **Acquired conditions**
  - **Preferential damage to previously normal myelin**
  - **Most common diseases in this group result from immune-mediated
    injury**
    - **multiple sclerosis (MS) and related disorders**
  - **Viral infection of oligodendrocytes**
    - **multifocal leukoencephalopathy**
  - **injury caused by drugs and other toxic agents**
- **Dysmyelinating diseases (Leukodystrophy)**
  - **Myelin is not formed properly**
  - **Has abnormal turnover kinetics**
  - **Mutations that disrupt the function of proteins that are required
    for the formation of normal myelin sheaths**

## DEMYELINATING DISEASES

## Multiple Sclerosis

- **Autoimmune demyelinating disorder**

- **Distinct episodes of neurologic deficits, separated in time,
  attributable to white matter lesions that are separated in space**

- **Most common demyelinating disorder**

  - **1/1000 persons in most of the United States and Europe**

- **May become clinically apparent at any age**

  - **onset in childhood or \>50 is rare**

- **F:M=2:1**

- **Relapsing and remitting episodes of neurologic impairment**

  - **frequency of relapses tends to decrease during the course of the
    illness**

- **A steady neurologic deterioration is characteristic in a subset of
  patients**

- **Combination of environmental and genetic factors**

- **Loss of tolerance to self myelin antigens**

- **Initiating agent, an infectious agent?**

- **15x higher when in first-degree relative**

- **Concordance rate for monozygotic twins 25%**

  - **much lower rate for dizygotic twins**

- **HLA-DR2 most significantly increases the risk for developing MS**

- **Polymorphisms in the genes cytokines IL-2 and IL-7**

  - **activation and regulation of T cell–mediated immune responses**

**Prominent chronic inflammatory cells within and around MS plaques**

**Genetic evidence**

**→ Immune-mediated myelin destruction have a central role**

**Central role for CD4+ T cells**

**Increase in TH17 and TH1 CD4+ cells**

**CD8+ T cells and B cells**

- **Sometimes axonal degeneration occurs**
  - **Toxic effects of lymphocytes, macrophages, and their secreted
    molecules**
  - **May cause neuronal death**

**Multiple Sclerosis**

**White matter disease**

**Affected areas showing multiple, well-circumscribed, slightly
depressed, glassy-appearing, gray-tan, irregularly shaped lesions**

**Plaques**

**Commonly arise near the ventricles**

**Frequent in the optic nerves and chiasm, brain stem, ascending and
descending fiber tracts, cerebellum, and spinal cord**

**Multiple Sclerosis**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Sharply defined borders**

- **Active plaque**
  - **Ongoing myelin breakdown**
  - **Abundant macrophages containing myelin debris**
  - **Lymphocytes and macrophages are present**
  - **Perivascular cuffs**
  - **Small active lesions often are centered on small veins**
  - **Axons are relatively preserved but may be reduced in number**
- **Active plaque**
- **Four classes, only one is seen in affected patient**
  - **Type I**
    - **macrophage infiltrates with sharp margins**
  - **Type II**
    - **Similar to type I**
    - **also complement deposition (antibody-mediated component)**
  - **Type III**
    - **Less well-defined borders**
    - **Oligodendrocyte apoptosis**
  - **Type IV**
    - **Nonapoptotic oligodendrocyte loss**
- **Inactive plaques**
  - **Inflammation mostly disappears**
  - **Little, no myelin**
  - **Astrocytic proliferation and gliosis are prominent**

## Clinical course of MS

**The clinical course is variable**

**Multiple relapses followed by episodes of remission**

**Recovery during remissions is not complete**

**Over time there is usually a gradual, often stepwise, accumulation of
neurologic deficits**

**Imaging studies have demonstrated that there are often more lesions in
the brains of patients with MS than might be expected from the clinical
examination**

**Lesions can come and go much more often than was previously
suspected**

- **Changes in cognitive function can be present**
  - **Much milder than the other deficits**
- **It is hard to predict when the next relapse will occur**
- **CSF examination**
  - **A mildly elevated protein level**
  - **Increased proportion of immunoglobulin**
    - **Oligoclonal bands**
    - **Antibodies are directed against a variety of antigenic targets**
  - **1/3 moderate pleocytosis**

## Other Acquired Demyelinating Diseases

- **Immune-mediated demyelination after systemic infectious illnesses**
  - **even mild viral diseases**
- **Not related to direct spread of the infectious agents to the nervous
  system**
  - **Immune cells responding to pathogen-associated antigens cross
    react against myelin antigens → myelin damage**

## Postinfectious autoimmune reactions to myelin

- **Associated with acute-onset monophasic illnesses**
- **Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis**
  - **Symptoms typically develop a week or two after an antecedent
    infection**
  - **Nonlocalizing (headache, lethargy, and coma)**
    - **In contrast with the focal findings of MS**
  - **Symptoms progress rapidly**
  - **Fatal in 20% of cases**
  - **Others recover completely**
- **Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis**
  - **More devastating disorder**
  - **Typically affects young adults and children**

## Neuromyelitis optica

**Inflammatory demyelinating disease**

**Centered on the optic nerves and spinal cord**

**Antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder**

**Antibodies to the water channel aquaporin-4 are both diagnostic and
pathogenic**

## Central pontine myelinolysis

- **Nonimmune process**
- **Loss of myelin involving the center of the pons**
- **Rapid correction of hyponatremia**
- **Mechanism of oligodendroglial cell injury is uncertain**
- **May be related to edema induced by sudden changes in osmotic
  pressure**
- **Alcoholism and severe electrolyte or osmolar imbalance**
- **Similar lesions can be found elsewhere in the brain**
- **Involvement of fibers in the pons**
  - **rapidly evolving quadriplegia**

## Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

**Demyelinating disease**

**Occurs after reactivation of JC virus in immunosuppressed patients**

## DYSMYELINATING DISEASES (LEUKODYSTROPHY)

## Leukodystrophies

**Inherited dysmyelinating diseases**

**Clinical symptoms derive from abnormal myelin synthesis or turnover**

**Lysosomal enzymes**

**Peroxisomal enzymes**

**Mutations in myelin proteins**

**Most are autosomal recessive inheritance**

**X-linked diseases also occur**

## Morphology of leukodystrophy

- **Changes in white matter**
- **Diffusely change in color (gray and translucent)**
- **Volume is decreased**
- **Early in their course**
  - **Some diseases may show patchy involvement**
  - **Others have a predilection for occipital lobe involvement**
- **End**
  - **Nearly all of the white matter usually is affected**
  - **Loss of white matter**
  - **Brain becomes atrophic**
  - **Ventricles enlarge**
  - **Secondary changes can be found in the gray matter**
- **Myelin loss**
- **Infiltration of macrophages**

- **Specific inclusions created by the accumulation of particular
  lipids**

## Clinical Features of Leukodystrophies

- **Each leukodystrophy has a characteristic clinical presentation**
- **Most can be diagnosed by genetic or biochemical methods**
- **Despite differences in underlying mechanisms share many features
  because of the common myelin target**
- **Affected children are normal at birth**
  - **Begin to miss developmental milestones during infancy and
    childhood**
- **Diffuse involvement of white matter**
  - **Deterioration in motor skills**
  - **Spasticity, hypotonia, or ataxia**
- **The earlier the age at onset, the more severe the deficiency and
  clinical course**

## ACQUIRED METABOLIC AND TOXIC DISTURBANCES

## Acquired Metabolic and Toxic Disturbances

- **Relatively common causes of neurologic illnesses**

- **If paraplegia has developed, recovery is poor**

## Hypoglycemia

**Brain requires glucose as a substrate for energy production**

**Cellular effects of diminished glucose generally resemble those of
global hypoxia**

**Hippocampal neurons are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic
injury**

**Cerebellar Purkinje cells are relatively spared**

**As with anoxia, if the level and duration of hypoglycemia are
sufficiently severe, injury is widespread**

## Hyperglycemia

- **Depressed levels of consciousness and sometimes coma**
- **Early stages**
  - **“flapping” tremor (asterixis) when extending the arms with palms
    facing the observer**
- **Elevated levels of ammonia**
  - **ammonia metabolism occurs only in astrocytes through the action of
    glutamine synthetase**
  - **hyperammonemia → astrocytes in the cortex and basal ganglia
    develop swollen, pale nuclei (called Alzheimer type II cells )**
