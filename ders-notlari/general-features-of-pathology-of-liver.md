## LIVER INJURY

## Degenerative, potentially reversible changes

**Accumulation of fat (steatosis)**

**Accumulation of bilirubin (cholestasis)**

## When injury is not reversible:Necrosis or Apoptosis

- **Necrosis**
  - **Ischemic/hypoxic injury**
  - **Response to oxidative stress**
- **Apoptosis**
  - **Acidophilic apoptotic bodies**
  - **Councilman bodies (yellow fever)**
  - **Acidophil bodies**

## Necrosis

- **Confluent necrosis**
  - **a severe, zonal loss of hepatocytes**
  - **widespread parenchymal loss**
  - **begin as a zone of hepatocyte dropout around the central vein →
    this space is filled by cellular debris, macrophages, and remnants
    of the reticulin meshwork**
- **Bridging necrosis**
  - **Necrosis zone link central veins to portal tracts or bridge
    adjacent portal tracts**

**apoptotic hepatocytes**

**acidophil bodies**

**focus of mononuclear infiltration **

**clusters of macrophages with eosinophilic cytoplasm indicate foci
where hepatocytes have undergone necrosis**

**Normal liver with patent portal and hepatic veins**

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver17.png)

**Extinction occurs when contiguous hepatocytes die, usually after
inflammatory injury to their blood supply **

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver18.png)

**Empty parenchyma collapses and begins to scar and adjacent portal
tracts and hepatic veins become approximated**

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver19.png)

**Scars in regions of extinction contract and condense, becoming fibrous
septa**

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver20.png)

**Septa elongate by the traction caused by hyperplasia of adjacent
hepatocytes**

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver21.png)

**Septa are resorbed. The resulting tissue has either venoportal fibrous
adhesions or hepatic veins that are closely approximated to portal
tracts. Portal tracts are remnants, often with no portal vein**

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver22.png)

## Regeneration of lost hepatocytes

- **Occurs primarily by mitotic replication of hepatocytes adjacent to
  those that have died, even when there is significant confluent
  necrosis**
- **Hepatocytes are almost stem cell-like in their ability to continue
  to replicate even in the setting of years of chronic injury**
  - **Stem cell replenishment is usually not a significant part of
    parenchymal repair.**
- **In most severe forms of acute liver failure**
  - **Activation of the primary intrahepatic stem cell niche (canal of
    Hering)**

## Scar Formation and Regression

- **Principal cell type involved in scar deposition is the hepatic
  stellate cell**
  - **Normally it is a lipid (vitamin A) storing cell**
  - **Become activated and are converted into highly fibrogenic
    myofibroblasts**
- **Stellate cells are activated by**
- **chronic inflammation, with production of inflammatory cytokines such
  as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin, and interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β), and lipid peroxidation products**
- **Cytokine and chemokine production by Kupffer cells, endothelial
  cells, hepatocytes, and bile duct epithelial cells**
- **In response to disruption of the extracellular matrix (ECM)**
- **Direct stimulation of stellate cells by toxins**

## ACUTE HEPATITIS

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver29.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

## Acute Hepatitis

- **Mild acute hepatitis gross inspection**

  - **Liver is normal or slightly mottled**

- **Massive hepatic necrosis**

  - **Shrink to 500 to 700 g**
  - **Limp, red organ covered by a wrinkled, baggy capsule**

- **Entire liver may be involved, or only patchy areas affected**

- **Necrotic areas have a muddy-red, mushy appearance with blotchy bile
  staining**

- **If patients survive for more than a week, surviving hepatocytes
  begin to regenerate**

- **If the parenchymal framework is preserved, regeneration is orderly
  and liver architecture is restored**

- **More massive destruction, regeneration is disorderly, yielding
  nodular masses of liver cells separated by granulation tissue and,
  eventually, scar, particularly in patients with a protracted course of
  submassive necrosis**

- **Hepatocyte injury**

- **Swelling (ballooning degeneration)**

  - **empty-appearing pale cytoplasm**
  - **rupture and undergo necrosis (cytolysis)**
  - **Necrotic cells appear to have dropped out, leaving collapsing
    sinusoidal collagen reticulin framework behind**

- **Apoptosis**

  - **Hepatocytes shrink**
  - **Intensely eosinophilic**
  - **Fragmented nuclei**
  - **Effector T cells may be present in the immediate vicinity**

- **When located in the parenchyma away from portal tracts, these
  features are called lobular hepatitis**

**Acute viral hepatitis showing disruption of lobular architecture,
inflammatory cells in sinusoids, and apoptotic cells **

**In severe cases, confluent necrosis of hepatocytes is seen around
central veins**

**Cellular debris, collapsed reticulin fibers, congestion/hemorrhage,
and variable inflammation**

**Increasing severity, central-portal bridging necrosis develops**

**Parenchymal collapse**

**Massive hepatic necrosis and fulminant liver failure**

**Massive hepatic necrosis**

**the wrinkled capsule and irregular nodularity of the generally
necrotic liver is due to collapse of the parenchyma**

**Massive necrosis, cut section of liver. The liver is small (700 g),
bile-stained, soft, and congested**

**Hepatocellular necrosis caused by acetaminophen overdose. Confluent
necrosis is seen in the perivenular region (zone 3)**

## CHRONIC HEPATITIS

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

## Chronic Hepatitis

**Portal inflammation in acute hepatitis is minimal or absent**

**Dense mononuclear portal infiltrates of variable prominence are the
defining lesion of chronic hepatitis**

**There is often interface hepatitis as well,**

**Distinguished from lobular hepatitis by its location at the interface
between hepatocellular parenchyma and portal stroma (or scars, when
present)**

**The hallmark of severe chronic liver damage is scarring. At first,
only portal tracts exhibit fibrosis, but in some patients, with time,
fibrous septa —bands of dense scar—will extend between portal tracts**

**In the most severe cases, continued scarring and nodule formation
leads to the development of cirrhosis**

## Grading and Staging of Chronic Hepatitis

- **Staging**
  - **Accessing the severity of fibrosis**
- **Grading**
  - **Accessing the severity of inflammation**
- **There are different systems for different diseases**
