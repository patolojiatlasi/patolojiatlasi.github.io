## EDEMA, HERNIATION, AND HYDROCEPHALUS

## Central Nervous System

- **Rigid skull and spinal canal**
- **Specific foramina**
  - **vessels and nerves pass**
- **Advantage of protection**
- **But cannot expand**
  - **generalized cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, mass lesions, tumors**

## EDEMA

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases1.png)

## Cerebral Edema

- **Accumulation of excess fluid within the brain parenchyma**
- **Vasogenic edema**
  - **Integrity of the normal blood-brain barrier is disrupted**
  - **Fluid shift from the vascular compartment into the extracellular
    spaces of the brain**
  - **Localized**
    - **increased vascular permeability due to inflammation, tumors**
  - **Generalized**
- **Cytotoxic edema**
  - **Increase in intracellular fluid**
  - **Neuronal and glial cell membrane injury**
  - **Generalized hypoxic-ischemic insult, exposure to some toxins**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases2.png)

**Edematous brain**

**Softer than normal**

**Appears to “over fill” the cranial vault**

**In generalized edema gyri are flattened, the intervening sulci are
narrowed, and the ventricular cavities are compressed**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Cerebral edema**

**Gyri are flattened as a result of compression of the expanding brain
by the dura mater and inner surface of the skull. Such changes are
associated with a dangerous increase in intracranial pressure.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

## HYDROCEPHALUS

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases4.png)

## Hydrocephalus

**CSF is produced by the choroid plexus within the ventricles**

**Circulates through the ventricular system**

**Flows through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie into the
subarachnoid space**

**Absorbed by arachnoid granulations**

**The balance between rates of generation and resorption regulates CSF
volume**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases5.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases6.png)

- **Accumulation of excessive CSF within the ventricular system**
- **Overproduction of CSF**
  - **Tumors of the choroid plexus**
  - **Rarely causes hydrocephalus**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases7.png)

- **Noncommunicating hydrocephalus**
  - **Localized obstacle to CSF flow within the ventricular system**
  - **A portion of the ventricles enlarges while the remainder does
    not**
  - **Masses obstructing the foramen of Monro or compressing the
    cerebral aqueduct**
- **Communicating hydrocephalus**
  - **Entire ventricular system is enlarged**
  - **Reduced CSF resorption**
- **In infancy before closure of the cranial sutures, the head
  enlarges**
- **Once the sutures fuse, hydrocephalus causes ventricular expansion
  and increased intracranial pressure, but no change in head
  circumference**
- **Hydrocephalus ex vacuo**
  - **A compensatory increase in CSF volume can also follow the loss of
    brain parenchyma after infarcts or with degenerative diseases**

## HERNIATION

## Herniation

- **Cranial vault is subdivided by rigid dural folds**
  - **falx and tentorium**
- **Intracranial pressure rises**
  - **Volume of tissue and fluid inside the skull increases beyond the
    limit permitted by compression of veins and displacement of CSF**
- **Focal expansion of the brain displaces it in relation to these
  partitions**
- **If the expansion is sufficiently large, herniation occurs**
- **Herniation often leads to “pinching” and vascular compromise of the
  compressed tissue**
  - **infarction, additional swelling, and further herniation**

## Subfalcine (cingulate) herniation

**Unilateral or asymmetric expansion of a cerebral hemisphere displaces
the cingulate gyrus under the edge of falx**

**Compression of the anterior cerebral artery**

**Subfalcial herniation**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases12.png)

## Transtentorial (uncinate) herniation

- **Medial aspect of the temporal lobe is compressed against the free
  margin of the tentorium**
- **Temporal lobe is displaced**
- **Third cranial nerve is compromised**
  - **Pupillary dilation and impaired ocular movements on the side of
    the lesion (“blown pupil”)**
- **Posterior cerebral artery may also be compressed**
  - **ischemic injury**
  - **primary visual cortex**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases13.png)

- **If herniation is big enough**
  - **compress the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the
    tentorium**
  - **hemiparesis ipsilateral to the side of the herniation (false
    localizing sign)**
- **Kernohan’s notch**
  - **Deformation formed by compression of the peduncle**

**Duret hemorrhages**

**-Progression of transtentorial herniation**

**-Linear or flame-shaped hemorrhages in the midbrain and pons**

**-Lesions usually occur in the midline and paramedian regions**

**-Result of tearing of penetrating veins and arteries supplying the
upper brain stem**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases16.png)

**Duret hemorrhage**

**Mass effect displaces the brain downward**

**Disruption of the vessels that enter the pons along the midline,
leading to hemorrhage**

## HYPOXIA, ISCHEMIA, AND INFARCTION

## Hypoxia

- **Brain is highly oxygen-dependent tissue**

- **Requires a continual supply of glucose and oxygen from the blood**

  - **2% of body weight**
  - **15% of the resting cardiac output**
  - **20% of total body oxygen consumption**

- **Cerebral blood flow auto-regulated for a stable blood pressure and
  intracranial pressure**

- **Functional hypoxia**

  - **Low partial pressure of oxygen**
    - **high altitude**
  - **Impaired oxygen-carrying capacity**
    - **severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning**
  - **Inhibition of oxygen use by tissue**
    - **cyanide poisoning**

- **Ischemia**

  - **Transient or permanent**
  - **Tissue hypoperfusion**
    - **Hypotension**
    - **Vascular obstruction**

## Global Cerebral Ischemia

- **Widespread ischemic-hypoxic injury**
- **Severe systemic hypotension**
  - **systolic pressures \<50 mm Hg**
  - **cardiac arrest, shock, and severe hypotension**
- **Neurons are more susceptible to hypoxic injury than glial cells**
  - **Mild or transient global ischemic insults may cause damage to
    vulnerable areas**
  - **Most susceptible neurons pyramidal cells of the hippocampus,
    neocortex and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum**
- **Severe global cerebral ischemia**
  - **widespread neuronal death irrespective of regional vulnerability**
- **Macroscopically**
  - **Brain is swollen**
  - **Wide gyri and narrowed sulci**

**Reaction to tissue damage**

**Infiltration by neutrophils**

**Infiltration of a cerebral infarction by neutrophils begins at the
edges of the lesion where the vascular supply is intact.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases22.png)

**Subacute changes**

**24 hours-2 weeks**

**Necrosis of tissue**

**Influx of macrophages**

**Vascular proliferation**

**Reactive gliosis**

**By day 10, an area of infarction shows the presence of macrophages and
surrounding reactive gliosis.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Cerebrovascular-diseases23.png)

**Repair**

**\> 2 weeks**

**Removal of all necrotic tissue**

**Loss of organized CNS structure, and gliosis**

**Old intracortical infarcts are seen as areas of tissue loss with a
modest amount of residual gliosis**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Border zone (“watershed”) infarcts**

**Wedge-shaped areas of infarction**

**Regions of the brain and spinal cord that lie at the most distal
portions of arterial territories**

**Seen after hypotensive episodes**

**Border zone between the anterior and the middle cerebral artery
distributions is at greatest risk**

## Focal Cerebral Ischemia

- **Cerebral arterial occlusion**
- **Focal ischemia**
- **Infarction in the distribution of the compromised vessel**
- **The size, location, and shape of the infarct and the extent of
  tissue damage that results may be modified by collateral blood flow**
- **Collateral flow through the circle of Willis or
  cortical-leptomeningeal anastomoses can limit damage in some regions**
- **There is little or no collateral flow to structures such as the
  thalamus, basal ganglia, and deep white matter**
  - **supplied by deep penetrating vessels**

## Embolic infarctions

- **More common than infarctions due to thrombosis**
- **Cardiac mural thrombi are a frequent source of emboli**
- **Thromboemboli arise in carotid arteries or aortic arch**
- **Middle cerebral artery**
  - **direct extension of the internal carotid artery**
  - **most frequently affected by embolic infarction**
- **Emboli tend to lodge where vessels branch or in areas of stenosis,
  usually caused by atherosclerosis**

## Thrombotic occlusions

**superimposed on atherosclerotic plaques**

**carotid bifurcation, the origin of the middle cerebral artery, and at
either end of the basilar artery**

**accompanied by anterograde extension, as well as thrombus
fragmentation and distal embolization**

## Infarcts

- **Nonhemorrhagic infarcts**
  - **Acute vascular occlusions**
  - **Treated with thrombolytic therapies**
- **Hemorrhagic infarcts**
  - **Result from reperfusion of ischemic tissue**
  - **Through collaterals or after dissolution of emboli**
  - **Often produce multiple, sometimes confluent petechial
    hemorrhages**

- **Wall of the cavity, astrocyte processes form a dense feltwork of
  glial fibers admixed with new capillaries and a few perivascular
  connective tissue fibers**

- **In the cerebral cortex, the cavity is delimited from the meninges
  and subarachnoid space by a gliotic layer of tissue, derived from the
  molecular layer of the cortex**

- **The pia and arachnoid are not affected**

  - **do not contribute to the healing process**
