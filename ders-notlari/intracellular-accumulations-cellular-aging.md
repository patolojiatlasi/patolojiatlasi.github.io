## Intracellular Accumulations and Cellular Aging

## Serdar BALCI, MD

## Intracellular Accumulations

- **One of the mechanisms of disease formation**
- **Cells may accumulate abnormal amounts of various substances**
- **May be harmless, may cause injury**
- **Localisation of accumulations:**
  - **In cytoplasm (in lysosomes)**
  - **In nucleus**
  - **May be exogenous or endogenous**

## INTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATION MECHANISMS

**Inadequate removal of a normal substance secondary to defects in
mechanisms of packaging and transport**

**Accumulation of an abnormal endogenous substance**

**Genetic or acquired defects**

**Folding, packaging, transport, or secretion**

**Deposition and accumulation of an abnormal exogenous substance**

**Cell cannot degrade or transport**

**Carbon or silica particles**

## Fatty Change (Steatosis)

- **Abnormal accumulation of triglycerides within parenchymal cells**
- **Most often seen in the liver**
  - **also in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney**
- **Caused by**
  - **Toxins**
  - **Protein malnutrition**
  - **Diabetes mellitus**
  - **Obesity**
  - **Anoxia**

- **Cells synthesize excessive amounts**
- **Kidney**
  - **normally trace amounts of albumin filtered through the glomerulus
    and reabsorbed**
  - **in heavy protein leakage disorders reabsorpted proteins accumulate
    in the cell as hyaline cytoplasmic droplets**
  - **A reversible injury**
- **Plasma cells**
  - **eosinophilic Russell bodies**
- **Liver**
  - **alcoholic hyaline**
- **Neurons**

## Lipofuscin “wear-and-tear pigment”

**insoluble brownish-yellow granular intracellular material**

**accumulates in heart, liver and brain**

**age or atrophy. **

**complexes of lipid and protein, free radical–catalyzed peroxidation of
polyunsaturated lipids of subcellular membranes**

**when present in large amounts an appearance to the tissue that is
called brown atrophy**

![](./img-local/Intracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging12.png)

**not injurious to the cell but a marker of past free radical injury**

**By electron microscopy, the pigment appears as perinuclear
electron-dense granules**

## Melanin

**an endogenous, brown-black pigment**

**synthesized by melanocytes located in the epidermis**

**screen against harmful ultraviolet radiation**

**adjacent basal keratinocytes in the skin accumulate the pigment **

**dermal macrophages**

**Differential Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology Figure 2-65: Blue Nevus**

## Hemosiderin

**hemoglobin-derived granular pigment**

**accumulates in tissues when there is a local or systemic excess of
iron**

**Iron is stored within cells with apoferritin, forming ferritin
micelles. Hemosiderin pigment represents large aggregates of ferritin
micelles**

![](./img-local/Intracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging14.png)

**readily visualized by light and electron microscopy**

![](./img-local/Intracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging15.png)

- **small amounts of this pigment are normal in the mononuclear
  phagocytes of the bone marrow, spleen, and liver, where aging red
  cells are normally degraded. **
- **Excessive deposition of hemosiderin**
  - **hemosiderosis**
  - **hereditary hemochromatosis**

## Other accumulations

**Amyloid**

**Hyaline change**

## 

**Usually, the word hyaline is used descriptively to refer to an
accumulation of pink, glassy material.** **Many processes can lead to
hyaline change, including:** **Protein accumulation (Russell bodies and
alcoholic hyaline are pink and glassy)**

**Scarring (fibrous tissue in old scars can look pink and glassy)**

**Vascular changes in hypertension and diabetes (extravasated plasma
proteins and deposition of basement membrane material can give the
vessel walls a  pink, glassy appearance)**

**Pigments (colored substances) are sometimes seen in histologic
sections. They can be normal or abnormal, and they may be from the
outside (exogenous) or made inside the body (endogenous). There are five
main pigments seen within tissues.** **1. Carbon (coal dust)** **This is
the most common exogenous pigment. It’s seen in urban dwellers, coal
miners and smokers. The official name for the blackening of the lungs
seen in these patients is anthracosis.** **2. Tattoo pigment** **Tattoo
pigments are often composed of metal salts (like iron oxide) but
vegetable dyes and plastic-based dyes may be used too. The pigment is
phagocytosed by dermal macrophages which retain the pigment for the
person’s lifetime.** **3. Lipofuscin** **This pigment, known as the
wear-and-tear pigment, is composed of a bunch of lipids and proteins and
has a yellow-brown appearance. ** **Here’s the awesome part. The name
lipofuscin is derived, in part, from the Latin word fuscus, which means
dingy, brown, or dark. That’s probably why “obfuscate” means “to make
unclear or obscure.” This is the weird kind of thing that makes me
inordinately happy. I have no idea why finding the Latin connection
between two seemingly unrelated words should make me happy in such
disproportionate measure - or happy at all - but it does. I try sharing
this kind of thing with others but they look at me strangely and back
away slightly.** **Happiness aside, lipofuscin accumulates with age, and
is of no clinical significance. **

**4. Melanin** **Melanin comes from the Greek word for black (melas).
This doesn’t make me as happy as fuscus. I don’t know why. It is a deep
brown-black pigment that is seen, not surprisingly, in melanocytes.**
**5. Hemosiderin** **This yellow-brown pigment is one of the major
storage forms of iron. It is normally seen in macrophages in the bone
marrow, spleen and liver (which are actively breaking down red cells).
It is also seen when there is a local excess of iron (as in a bruise) or
systemic excess of iron (for example, in patients with repeated blood
transfusions.**

## PATHOLOGIC CALCIFICATION

## Pathologic Calcification

**Abnormal deposition of calcium salts**

**Together with smaller amounts of iron, magnesium, and other minerals**

- **Dystrophic calcification**
  - **deposition occurs in dead or dying tissues**
  - **no defect in calcium metabolism**
  - **serum levels of calcium is normal**
- **Metastatic calcification**
  - **deposition of calcium salts in normal tissues**
  - **is almost always secondary to hypercalcemia**
- **Hypercalcemia is not a prerequisite for dystrophic calcification,
  but it can exacerbate it.**

## Dystrophic Calcification

- **In areas of necrosis of any type**
- **Atheromas of advanced atherosclerosis**
  - **intimal injury in the aorta and large arteries**
  - **characterized by accumulation of lipids**
- **may be an incidental finding**
  - **insignificant past cell injury**
- **may be a cause of organ dysfunction**
  - **aging or damaged heart valves**
  - **severely compromised valve motion**
- **Dystrophic calcification of the aortic valves is an important cause
  of aortic stenosis in elderly persons**

![](./img-local/Intracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging23.png)

## Pathogenesis of dystrophic calcification

**initiation (or nucleation) and propagation**

**may be either intracellular or extracellular**

**end product is crystalline calcium phosphate**

## Initiation in extracellular sites

- **Occurs in membrane-bound vesicles about 200 nm in diameter**
  - **in normal cartilage and bone they are known as matrix vesicles**
  - **in pathologic calcification they derive from degenerating cells**
- **Calcium is initially concentrated in these vesicles by its affinity
  for membrane phospholipids**
- **Phosphates accumulate as a result of the action of membrane-bound
  phosphatases**

## Intracellular calcification

**in the mitochondria of dead or dying cells that have lost their
ability to regulate intracellular calcium**

## Propagation of crystal formation

- **depends on:**
  - **the concentration of Ca2+ and PO4−**
  - **presence of mineral inhibitors**
  - **degree of collagenization**
    - **enhances the rate of crystal growth**

## Metastatic calcification

**Occur in normal tissues**

**There is hypercalcemia**

## Causes of hypercalcemia

- **Increased secretion of parathyroid hormone**
  - **primary parathyroid tumors**
  - **production of parathyroid hormone–related protein by other
    malignant tumors**
- **Destruction of bone accelerated turnover**
  - **Paget disease**
  - **immobilization**
  - **tumors**
    - **increased bone catabolism**
    - **multiple myeloma**
    - **leukemia**
    - **diffuse skeletal metastases**
- **Vitamin D–related disorders**
  - **vitamin D intoxication**
  - **sarcoidosis**
    - **macrophages activate a vitamin D precursor**
- **Renal failure**
  - **Phosphate retention leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism**

## Morphology of Calcification

- **White granules or clumps, often felt as gritty deposits**
- **Dystrophic calcification is common in caseous necrosis in
  tuberculosis**
  - **tuberculous lymph node is seen as a radiopaque stone**

## Morphology

**intracellular and/or extracellular basophilic deposits**

**Heterotopic bone may be formed in the focus of calcification.**

## CELLULAR AGING

## Why do we age?

![](./img-local/Intracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging25.jpg)

**Underwood’s Pathology: A Clinical Approach , Sixth Edition**

- **Individuals age, because their cells age**
- **aging is regulated by a limited number of genes and signaling
  pathways**
  - **observed from yeast to mammals**

## DNA damage

**Metabolic insults that accumulate over time**

**Result in damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA**

**Most DNA damage is repaired by DNA repair enzymes**

**Some persists and accumulates as cells age**

**Aging syndromes are associated with defects in DNA repair mechanisms**

**Life span of experimental animals can be increased if responses to DNA
damage are enhanced or proteins that stabilize DNA are introduced**

**Role of free radicals remains controversial**

## Decreased cellular replication

- **Normal cells have a limited capacity for replication**
- **Cells become arrested in a terminally nondividing state replicative
  senescence**
- **Cells from children have the capacity to undergo more rounds of
  replication than olders**
- **Werner syndrome**
  - **a rare disease characterized by premature aging**
  - **Cells have a markedly reduced in vitro life span**

## Telomeres

**short repeated sequences of DNA present at the ends of linear
chromosomes**

**a small section of the telomere is not duplicated, and telomeres
become progressively shortened**

**the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken
DNA**

**signals cell cycle arrest**

![](./img-local/Intracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging26.png)

## Telomerase

**Telomere length is maintained by nucleotide addition**

**a specialized RNA-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template
for adding nucleotides to the ends of chromosomes**

## Telomerase activity

- **present in germ cells**
- **present at low levels in stem cells**
- **absent in most somatic tissues**
  - **most somatic cells age, their telomeres become shorter, exit the
    cell cycle, inability to generate new cells**
- **In immortalized cancer cells**
  - **telomerase is usually reactivated**
  - **telomere length is stabilized**
  - **the cells to proliferate indefinitely**

![](./img-local/Intracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging27.png)

## Defective protein homeostasis

- **increased turnover**
- **decreased synthesis**
- **reduced translation of proteins**
- **defective activity**
  - **chaperones**
    - **promote normal protein folding**
  - **Proteasomes**
    - **destroy misfolded proteins**
  - **repair enzymes**
- **effects on**
  - **cell survival, replication, and functions**
  - **lead to accumulation of misfolded proteins**
  - **can trigger pathways of apoptosis**
