**The backbone of this lecture is Robbins Basic Pathology**

**The other references are given at the end of lecture**

**One cannot learn pathology (and medicine), solely based on “lecture
notes”, you should use textbooks**

**Medicine is an ever changing science, you should follow the newest
information by appropriate means**

**I have no conflict of interest with any publisher**
