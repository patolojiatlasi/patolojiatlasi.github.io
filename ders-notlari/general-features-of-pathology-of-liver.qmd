# LIVER INJURY

# Degenerative, potentially reversible changes

__Accumulation of fat \(steatosis\)__

__Accumulation of bilirubin \(cholestasis\)__

# When injury is not reversible:Necrosis or Apoptosis

* __Necrosis__
  * __Ischemic/hypoxic injury__
  * __Response to oxidative stress__
* __Apoptosis__
  * __Acidophilic apoptotic bodies__
  * __Councilman bodies \(yellow fever\)__
  * __Acidophil bodies__

# Necrosis

* __Confluent necrosis__
  * __a severe\, zonal loss of hepatocytes__
  * __widespread parenchymal loss__
  * __begin as a zone of hepatocyte dropout around the central vein → this space is filled by cellular debris\, macrophages\, and remnants of the reticulin meshwork__
* __Bridging necrosis__
  * __Necrosis zone link central veins to portal tracts or bridge adjacent portal tracts__

__apoptotic hepatocytes__

__acidophil bodies__

__focus of mononuclear infiltration __

__clusters of macrophages with eosinophilic cytoplasm indicate foci where hepatocytes have undergone necrosis__

__Normal liver with patent portal and hepatic veins__

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver17.png)

__Extinction occurs when contiguous hepatocytes die\, usually after inflammatory injury to their blood supply __

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver18.png)

__Empty parenchyma collapses and begins to scar and adjacent portal tracts and hepatic veins become approximated__

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver19.png)

__Scars in regions of extinction contract and condense\, becoming fibrous septa__

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver20.png)

__Septa elongate by the traction caused by hyperplasia of adjacent hepatocytes__

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver21.png)

__Septa are resorbed\. The resulting tissue has either venoportal fibrous adhesions or hepatic veins that are closely approximated to portal tracts\. Portal tracts are remnants\, often with no portal vein__

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver22.png)

# Regeneration of lost hepatocytes

* __Occurs primarily by mitotic replication of hepatocytes adjacent to those that have died\, even when there is significant confluent necrosis__
* __Hepatocytes are almost stem cell\-like in their ability to continue to replicate even in the setting of years of chronic injury__
  * __Stem cell replenishment is usually not a significant part of parenchymal repair\.__
* __In most severe forms of acute liver failure__
  * __Activation of the primary intrahepatic stem cell niche \(canal of Hering\)__

# Scar Formation and Regression

* __Principal cell type involved in scar deposition is the hepatic stellate cell__
  * __Normally it is a lipid \(vitamin A\) storing cell__
  * __Become activated and are converted into highly fibrogenic myofibroblasts__
* __Stellate cells are activated by__
* __chronic inflammation\, with production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \(TNF\)\, lymphotoxin\, and interleukin\-1β \(IL\-1β\)\, and lipid peroxidation products__
* __Cytokine and chemokine production by Kupffer cells\, endothelial cells\, hepatocytes\, and bile duct epithelial cells__
* __In response to disruption of the extracellular matrix \(ECM\)__
* __Direct stimulation of stellate cells by toxins__

# ACUTE HEPATITIS

![](./img-local/General-Features-of-Pathology-of-Liver29.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Acute Hepatitis

* __Mild acute hepatitis gross inspection__
  * __Liver is normal or slightly mottled__
* __Massive hepatic necrosis__
  * __Shrink to 500 to 700 g__
  * __Limp\, red organ covered by a wrinkled\, baggy capsule__
* __Entire liver may be involved\, or only patchy areas affected__
* __Necrotic areas have a muddy\-red\, mushy appearance with blotchy bile staining__
* __If patients survive for more than a week\, surviving hepatocytes begin to regenerate__
* __If the parenchymal framework is preserved\, regeneration is orderly and liver architecture is restored__
* __More massive destruction\, regeneration is disorderly\, yielding nodular masses of liver cells separated by granulation tissue and\, eventually\, scar\, particularly in patients with a protracted course of submassive necrosis__

* __Hepatocyte injury__
* __Swelling \(ballooning degeneration\)__
  * __empty\-appearing pale cytoplasm__
  * __rupture and undergo necrosis \(cytolysis\)__
  * __Necrotic cells appear to have dropped out\, leaving collapsing sinusoidal collagen reticulin framework behind__
* __Apoptosis__
  * __Hepatocytes shrink__
  * __Intensely eosinophilic__
  * __Fragmented nuclei__
  * __Effector T cells may be present in the immediate vicinity__
* __When located in the parenchyma away from portal tracts\, these features are called lobular hepatitis__

__Acute viral hepatitis showing disruption of lobular architecture\, inflammatory cells in sinusoids\, and apoptotic cells __

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__In severe cases\, confluent necrosis of hepatocytes is seen around central veins__

__Cellular debris\, collapsed reticulin fibers\, congestion/hemorrhage\, and variable inflammation__

__Increasing severity\, central\-portal bridging necrosis develops__

__Parenchymal collapse__

__Massive hepatic necrosis and fulminant liver failure__

__Massive hepatic necrosis__

__the wrinkled capsule and irregular nodularity of the generally necrotic liver is due to collapse of the parenchyma__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

__Massive necrosis\, cut section of liver\. The liver is small \(700 g\)\, bile\-stained\, soft\, and congested__

__Hepatocellular necrosis caused by acetaminophen overdose\. Confluent necrosis is seen in the perivenular region \(zone 3\)__

# CHRONIC HEPATITIS

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Chronic Hepatitis

__Portal inflammation in acute hepatitis is minimal or absent__

__Dense mononuclear portal infiltrates of variable prominence are the defining lesion of chronic hepatitis__

__There is often interface hepatitis as well\,__

__Distinguished from lobular hepatitis by its location at the interface between hepatocellular parenchyma and portal stroma \(or scars\, when present\)__

__The hallmark of severe chronic liver damage is scarring\. At first\, only portal tracts exhibit fibrosis\, but in some patients\, with time\, fibrous septa —bands of dense scar—will extend between portal tracts__

__In the most severe cases\, continued scarring and nodule formation leads to the development of cirrhosis__

# Grading and Staging of Chronic Hepatitis

* __Staging__
  * __Accessing the severity of fibrosis__
* __Grading__
  * __Accessing the severity of inflammation__
* __There are different systems for different diseases__
