## Cholestatic Liver Diseases

- **Primary hepatocellular dysfunction**
  - **neonatal cholestasis, drug cholestasis, sepsis**
- **Bile duct injuries**
  - **Mechanical**
    - **obstruction of large ducts by stones or tumor**
  - **Inflammatory**
    - **autoimmune diseases**
- **Diseases may affect both intra- and extrahepatic segments**
- **Exclusively extrahepatic biliary disorders may still cause secondary
  changes within the liver**

**Cholestatic hepatocytes are enlarged with dilated canalicular
spaces.**

**Apoptotic cells.**

**Kupffer cells frequently contain regurgitated bile pigments**

## Large bile duct obstruction

- **Associated with**
  - **Gallstones**
  - **Malignancies involving the head of the pancreas**
- **Complications**
  - **Chronic obstruction can lead to cirrhosis**
  - **Ascending cholangitis may develop**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver12.png)

**Acute large duct obstruction. Marked edema, ductular reaction,
neutrophils**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver13.png)

**Ascending cholangitis**

**Large bile duct obstruction → static bile → bacterial infections
within the biliary tree**

## Primary hepatolithiasis

**Disorder of intrahepatic gallstone formation**

**Most common in East Asia**

**Causes repeated bouts of ascending cholangitis and inflam­matory
parenchymal destruction**

**Predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver14.png)

## Neonatal Cholestasis

- **Mild transient elevations in serum unconjugated bilirubin are common
  in normal newborns**
- **Neonatal cholestasis**
  - **Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia**
  - **Lasts beyond the first 14 days of life**
- **Causes**
- **Extrahepatic biliary atresia**
- **Neonatal hepatitis**
  - **not a specific entity, nor are the disorders necessarily
    inflammatory**
  - **Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis**
    - **10-15% of cases of neonatal hepatitis**

**Neonatal hepatitis. Multinucleated giant hepatocytes**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver15.png)

- **Clinical presentation**
  - **Jaundice**
  - **Dark urine**
  - **Light or acholic stools**
  - **Hepatomegaly**
  - **Hypoprothrombinemia**
- **Extrahepatic biliary atresia**
  - **surgery**
- **Idiopathic hepatitis**

## Cholestasis of Sepsis

- **Intrahepatic bacterial infection**
  - **Abscess formation**
  - **Bacterial cholangitis**
- **Ischemia**
  - **Septic shock**
- **In response to circulating microbial products**
  - **gram-negative organisms**

## Cholestasis of SepsisCanalicular cholestasis

**Bile plugs within predominantly centrilobular canaliculi**

**Prominent activated Kupffer cells**

**Mild portal inflammation**

**Hepatocyte necrosis is scant or absent **

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver16.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

## Cholestasis of SepsisDuctular cholestasis

**Canals of Hering and bile ductules at the interface of portal tracts
and parenchyma become dilated and contain prominent bile plugs**

**Not a typical feature of biliary obstruction**

**Accompanies or even precedes the development of septic shock**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver17.png)

**Ductular cholestasis. Large, dark bile concretions within markedly
dilated canals of Hering and ductules at the portal-parenchymal
interface. This feature, indicative of current or impending severe
sepsis, is related to endotoxemia.**

## AUTOIMMUNE CHOLANGIOPATHIES

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver18.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

## PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS (PBC)

## Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC)

- **Autoimmune disease**
- **Inflammatory, often granulomatous**
- **Chronic, progressive, and sometimes fatal cholestatic liver
  disease**
- **Destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts**
  - **Nonsuppurative destruction of small and medium-sized intrahepatic
    bile ducts**
- **Portal inflammation and scarring**
- **Development of cirrhosis and liver failure over years to decades**
- **Disease of middle-aged women, peak incidence 40-50 years**
- **Autoantibodies (AMA)**
- **Associated with other autoimmune diseases Sjögren syndrome and
  Hashimoto thyroiditis**

## Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

- **High titers of autoantibodies directed against several mitochondrial
  acid dehydrogenases**
- **Interlobular bile ducts are actively destroyed by lymphocytic or
  plasmacytic inflammation**
- **With or without granulomas (the florid duct lesion)**
- **Portal tracts lacking bile ducts, ductopenia**
- **Ductular reaction**
  - **Bile ductular proliferation**
- **Inflammation and necrosis of the adjacent periportal parenchyma**
- **Portal-portal septal fibrosis**
- **Mild interface and lobular hepatitis also may be present**

**Biliary cirrhosis. Sagittal section through the liver demonstrates the
nodularity and bile staining of end-stage biliary cirrhosis.**

**Unlike other forms of cirrhosis, nodules of liver cells in biliary
cirrhosis are often not round but irregular, like jigsaw puzzle shapes**

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

**Primary biliary cirrhosis. A portal tract is markedly expanded by an
infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Granulomatous reaction to a
bile duct undergoing destruction (florid duct lesion)**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver22.png)

- **Ductular reaction**
- **Earlier stages of disease**
  - **help maintain bile flow**
- **Later stages**
  - **contribute to subsequent scarring **

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver23.png)

**ductular reaction in a fibrotic septum**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Overlap syndrome**
  - **The features sometimes overlap with those of autoimmune
    hepatitis**
  - **When the hepatitic component is very prominent and there are
    serologic findings typical for autoimmune hepatitis**

## Primary Biliary CirrhosisTwo paths to end-stage liver disease

- **Prominent portal hypertension**
  - **Widespread nodularity without the surrounding scar tissue seen in
    cirrhosis**
    - **nodular regenerative hyperplasia**
  - **Liver larger than normal and may show a vague nodularity that
    differs from the obvious nodules of cirrhosis**
- **Increasingly widespread duct loss**
  - **Cirrhosis and profound cholestasis**
  - **Bile accumulation periportal/periseptal**
  - **feathery degeneration marked by ballooned, bile-stained
    hepatocytes, often with prominent Mallory-Denk bodies**
    - **not centrilobular, as in drug-induced or sepsis-associated
      cholestatic syndromes**
    - **similar to those seen in alcoholic hepatitis, differ by their
      periportal rather than centrilobular location**
- **Cirrhosis and vivid green discoloration, matching the patient’s
  general icteric state**
- **There is little hepatocyte loss**
  - **regenerative nodular hyperplasia, hepatomegaly**
  - **different from shrunken livers of chronic hepatitis or
    alcoholism**

**Primary biliary cirrhosis, end stage. This sagittal section
demonstrates liver enlargement, nodularity indicative of cirrhosis, and
green discoloration due to cholestasis**

## PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS (PSC)

## Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)

- **Autoimmune disease**

- **Progressive inflammatory and sclerosing destruction of bile ducts of
  all sizes**

  - **intrahepatic and extrahepatic**

- **Diagnosis is made by radiologic imaging of the biliary tree**

- **Most often in younger men**

- **Strong associations with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly
  ulcerative colitis**

- **Chronic cholestatic disorder**

- **Progressive fibrosis and destruction of extrahepatic and
  intrahepatic bile ducts of all sizes**

- **Patchy**

- **Cholangiography shows a characteristic beading in the affected
  segments of the biliary tree**

  - **narrow strictures alternating with normal sized or dilated ducts**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver25.png)

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

## Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

- **Seen in association with inflammatory bowel disease**

  - **Ulcerative colitis coexists in approximately 70% of affected
    patients**
  - **Prevalence of PSC among persons with ulcerative colitis is about
    4%. **

- **Linkage with certain HLA-DR alleles**

- **Antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies with a perinuclear localization**

- **Largest ducts**

  - **Chronic inflammation with superimposed acute inflammation**
  - **Similar to the mucosal lesions of ulcerative colitis**
  - **Narrowing of the larger ducts**
    - **edema and inflammation**
    - **scarring**

- **Smaller ducts**

  - **little inflammation**
  - **striking circumferential fibrosis**
    - **onion skinning around an increasingly atrophic duct lumen**
  - **Lumen disappears, dense button of scar tissue, tombstone scar**

- **Diagnosis depends on radiologic imaging of the extrahepatic and
  largest intrahepatic ducts**

**Primary sclerosing cholangitis. A bile duct undergoing degeneration is
entrapped in a dense, “onion-skin” concentric scar.**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver26.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **In response to duct loss;**
  - **bile ductular proliferation**
- **portal-portal septal fibrosis**
- **cirrhosis**
- **The end-stage liver is usually cirrhotic and green**
- **Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia may appear**

## Portal Vein Obstruction and Thrombosis

- **Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction may arise from:**
  - **Peritoneal sepsis**
    - **acute diverticulitis, appendicitis leading to pylephlebitis in
      the splanchnic circulation**
  - **Pancreatitis initiating splenic vein thrombosis, propagates into
    the portal vein**
  - **Thrombogenic diseases and postsurgical thromboses**
  - **Vascular invasion by primary or secondary cancer in the liver that
    progressively occludes portal inflow to the liver**
  - **Banti syndrome**
    - **subclinical thrombosis of the portal vein, fibrotic, partially
      recanalized vascular channel**
    - **splenomegaly or esophageal varices years later**
  - **Cirrhosis**
    - **reduces the flow of blood in the portal veins**
    - **leads to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis**
- **Intrahepatic thrombosis of a portal vein**

**Cirrhosis**

**Sickle cell disease**

**Disseminated intravascular coagulation**

**Eclampsia**

**Sickle cell crisis in liver**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver33.png)

## Passive Congestion and Centrilobular Necrosis

- **Right-sided cardiac decompensation**

  - **Passive congestion of the liver**
  - **Centrilobular necrosis and perivenular fibrosis in the areas of
    necrosis**

- **Liver is slightly enlarged, tense, and cyanotic, with rounded
  edges**

- **Congestion of centrilobular sinusoids**

- **Centrilobular hepatocytes become atrophic**

- **Markedly attenuated liver cell cords**

- **Sustained, chronic, severe congestive heart failure → cardiac
  sclerosis**

- **Rarely bridging fibrous septa and cirrhosis develop**

- **Left-sided cardiac failure or shock**

  - **Hepatic hypoperfusion and hypoxia**
  - **Two areas most dependent on arterial flow, centrilobular
    hepatocytes and bile ducts, undergo ischemic necrosis**

- **Combination of left-sided hypoperfusion and right-sided retrograde
  congestion acts synergistically to generate centrilobular hemorrhagic
  necrosis**

- **Mottled appearance**

  - **hemorrhage and necrosis in the centrilobular regions, alternating
    with pale midzonal areas**
  - **nutmeg liver**

  thrombi or organized adherent thrombi**

![](./img-local/Circulatory-and-Cholestatic-Disorders-of-Liver39.png)

**Budd-Chiari syndrome. Thrombosis of the major hepatic veins has caused
profound hepatic congestion.**

## Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome

**Venoocclusive disease**

**Toxic injury to sinusoidal endothelium**

**Damaged endothelial cells slough, leading to formation of thrombi that
block sinusoidal flow**

**Endothelial damage allows red cells to spill into the space of Disse,
causes proliferation of stellate cells and fibrosis of terminal branches
of the hepatic vein**

**Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. A central vein is occluded by cells
and newly formed collagen. There is also fibrosis in the sinusoidal
spaces.**
