__The latent period for developing malignant mesothelioma is long__

__25\-40 years after initial asbestos exposure__

__With combination of cigarette smoking\, asbestos exposure greatly increases the risk of lung carcinoma__

* __Preceded by extensive pleural fibrosis and plaque formation__
* __Begin in a localized area and over time spread widely__
  * __contiguous growth or by diffusely seeding the pleural surfaces__
* __Lung typically is ensheathed by a yellow\-white\, firm\, sometimes gelatinous layer of tumor that obliterates the pleural space__

__Distant metastases are rare__

__Directly invade the thoracic wall or the subpleural lung tissue__

# Mesothelioma patterns

* __Normal mesothelial cells are biphasic__
  * __Pleural lining cells__
  * __Underlying fibrous tissue__
* __Mesothelioma patterns__
  * __Epithelial__
    * __Cuboidal cells line tubular and microcystic spaces__
    * __Small papillary buds project__
    * __Most common pattern__
    * __Confused with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma__
  * __Sarcomatous__
    * __Spindled and sometimes fibroblastic\-appearing cells__
    * __Nondistinctive sheets__
  * __Biphasic\, having both sarcomatous and epithelial areas__

# Asbestos

* __Not removed__

# THYMOMA

# Thymoma

__Tumors of thymic epithelial cells__

__Typically also contain benign immature T cells \(thymocytes\)__

__Tumors that are cytologically benign and noninvasive__

__Tumors that are cytologically benign but invasive or metastatic__

__Tumors that are cytologically malignant \(thymic carcinoma\)__

* __>40 years old__
* __No gender difference__
* __Localisation:__
  * __Most arise in the anterior superior mediastinum__
  * __Sometimes they occur in the neck\, thyroid\, pulmonary hilus\, or elsewhere__
  * __Uncommon in the posterior mediastinum__
  * __20\-30% of tumors in the anterosuperior mediastinum\, which is also a common location for certain lymphomas__

# Clinical Presentation of Thymomas

__Myasthenia gravis __

__Hypogammaglobulinemia__

__Pure red cell aplasia__

__Graves disease__

__Pernicious anemia__

__Dermatomyositis\-polymyositis__

__Cushing syndrome__

# Autoimmune Diseases Associated with Thymoma

__Thymocytes within thymomas give rise to long\-lived CD4\+ and CD8\+ T cells__

__Cortical thymomas rich in thymocytes are more likely to be associated with autoimmune disease__

__Abnormalities in the selection or “education” of T cells maturing within the environment of the neoplasm contribute to the development of diverse autoimmune disorders__

# Thymomas

* __Macroscopically__
  * __Lobulated__
  * __Firm__
  * __Gray\-white masses__
  * __15\-20 cm__
  * __Sometimes cystic necrosis and calcification__
  * __Most encapsulated__
  * __20\-25% penetrate the capsule and infiltrate perithymic tissues and structures__

__Gross appearance of a thymoma showing distinct multinodularity\. There is focal cystic change in the larger nodule\. __

# Noninvasive thymomas

__Composed of medullary\-type epithelial cells__

__Mixture of medullary and cortical type epithelial cells__

__The medullary type epithelial cells are elongated or spindle\-shaped__

__There is usually a sparse infiltrate of thymocytes\, which often recapitulate the phenotype of medullary thymocytes__

__Benign thymoma \(medullary type\):__

__Neoplastic epithelial cells in a swirling pattern and have bland\, oval to elongated nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli\. Few small\, reactive lymphoid cells are interspersed\.__

![](img%5CDiseases-and-Tumors-of-the-Mediastinum-and-Pleura11.png)

# Invasive thymoma

__Tumor that is cytologically benign but locally invasive__

__Much more likely to metastasize__

__Epithelial cells are most commonly of the cortical variety\, with abundant cytoplasm and rounded vesicular nuclei\, and are usually mixed with numerous thymocytes__

__Malignant thymoma\, type I\. The neoplastic epithelial cells are polygonal and have round to oval\, bland nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli\. Numerous small\, reactive lymphoid cells are interspersed\.__
