# Chronic Inflammation

* __inflammation of prolonged duration \(weeks to years\)__
* __continuing inflammation__
* __tissue injury__
* __healing__
  * __often by fibrosis__

__proceed simultaneously__

* __Infiltration with mononuclear cells__
  * __macrophages\, lymphocytes\, and plasma cells__
* __Tissue destruction__
  * __induced by the products of the inflammatory cells__
