__Pigments \(colored substances\) are sometimes seen in histologic sections\. They can be normal or abnormal\, and they may be from the outside \(exogenous\) or made inside the body \(endogenous\)\. There are five main pigments seen within tissues\.__  __1\. Carbon \(coal dust\)__  __This is the most common exogenous pigment\. It's seen in urban dwellers\, coal miners and smokers\. The official name for the blackening of the lungs seen in these patients is anthracosis\.__  __2\. Tattoo pigment__  __Tattoo pigments are often composed of metal salts \(like iron oxide\) but vegetable dyes and plastic\-based dyes may be used too\. The pigment is phagocytosed by dermal macrophages which retain the pigment for the person's lifetime\.__  __3\. Lipofuscin__  __This pigment\, known as the wear\-and\-tear pigment\, is composed of a bunch of lipids and proteins and has a yellow\-brown appearance\. __  __Here's the awesome part\. The name lipofuscin is derived\, in part\, from the Latin word fuscus\, which means dingy\, brown\, or dark\. That's probably why "obfuscate" means "to make unclear or obscure\." This is the weird kind of thing that makes me inordinately happy\. I have no idea why finding the Latin connection between two seemingly unrelated words should make me happy in such disproportionate measure \- or happy at all \- but it does\. I try sharing this kind of thing with others but they look at me strangely and back away slightly\.__  __Happiness aside\, lipofuscin accumulates with age\, and is of no clinical significance\. __

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Agingpptx-kopyas%C4%B121.jpg)

__4\. Melanin__  __Melanin comes from the Greek word for black \(melas\)\. This doesn't make me as happy as fuscus\. I don't know why\. It is a deep brown\-black pigment that is seen\, not surprisingly\, in melanocytes\.__  __5\. Hemosiderin__  __This yellow\-brown pigment is one of the major storage forms of iron\. It is normally seen in macrophages in the bone marrow\, spleen and liver \(which are actively breaking down red cells\)\. It is also seen when there is a local excess of iron \(as in a bruise\) or systemic excess of iron \(for example\, in patients with repeated blood transfusions\.__

# PATHOLOGIC CALCIFICATION

# Pathologic Calcification

__Abnormal deposition of calcium salts__

__Together with smaller amounts of iron\, magnesium\, and other minerals__

* __Dystrophic calcification__
  * __deposition occurs in dead or dying tissues__
  * __no defect in calcium metabolism__
  * __serum levels of calcium is normal__
* __Metastatic calcification__
  * __deposition of calcium salts in normal tissues__
  * __is almost always secondary to hypercalcemia__
* __Hypercalcemia is not a prerequisite for dystrophic calcification\, but it can exacerbate it\.__

# Dystrophic Calcification

* __In areas of necrosis of any type__
* __Atheromas of advanced atherosclerosis__
  * __intimal injury in the aorta and large arteries__
  * __characterized by accumulation of lipids__
* __may be an incidental finding__

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Agingpptx-kopyas%C4%B123.png)

# Pathogenesis of dystrophic calcification

__initiation \(or nucleation\) and propagation__

__may be either intracellular or extracellular__

__end product is crystalline calcium phosphate__

# Initiation in extracellular sites

* __Occurs in membrane\-bound vesicles about 200 nm in diameter__
  * __in normal cartilage and bone they are known as matrix vesicles__
  * __in pathologic calcification they derive from degenerating cells__
* __Calcium is initially concentrated in these vesicles by its affinity for membrane phospholipids__
* __Phosphates accumulate as a result of the action of membrane\-bound phosphatases__

# Intracellular calcification

__in the mitochondria of dead or dying cells that have lost their ability to regulate intracellular calcium__

# Propagation of crystal formation

* __depends on:__
  * __the concentration of Ca2\+ and PO4−__
  * __presence of mineral inhibitors__
  * __degree of collagenization__
    * __enhances the rate of crystal growth__

# Metastatic calcification

__Occur in normal tissues__

__There is hypercalcemia__

# Causes of hypercalcemia

  * __vitamin D intoxication__
  * __sarcoidosis__
    * __macrophages activate a vitamin D precursor__

* __Renal failure__

# Morphology of Calcification

* __White granules or clumps\, often felt as gritty deposits__
* __Dystrophic calcification is common in caseous necrosis in tuberculosis__
  * __tuberculous lymph node is seen as a radiopaque stone__

# Morphology

__intracellular and/or extracellular basophilic deposits__

__Heterotopic bone may be formed in the focus of calcification\.__
