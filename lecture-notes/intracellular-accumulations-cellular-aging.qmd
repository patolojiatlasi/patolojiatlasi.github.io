# Lipofuscin “wear-and-tear pigment”

__insoluble brownish\-yellow granular intracellular material__

__accumulates in heart\, liver and brain__

__age or atrophy\. __

__complexes of lipid and protein\, free radical–catalyzed peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids of subcellular membranes__

__when present in large amounts an appearance to the tissue that is called brown atrophy__

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging12.png)

__not injurious to the cell but a marker of past free radical injury__

__By electron microscopy\, the pigment appears as perinuclear electron\-dense granules__

# Melanin

__an endogenous\, brown\-black pigment__

__synthesized by melanocytes located in the epidermis__

__screen against harmful ultraviolet radiation__

__adjacent basal keratinocytes in the skin accumulate the pigment __

__dermal macrophages__

__Differential Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology Figure 2\-65: Blue Nevus__

# Hemosiderin

__hemoglobin\-derived granular pigment__

__accumulates in tissues when there is a local or systemic excess of iron__

__Iron is stored within cells with apoferritin\, forming ferritin micelles\. Hemosiderin pigment represents large aggregates of ferritin micelles__

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging14.png)

__readily visualized by light and electron microscopy__

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging15.png)

* __small amounts of this pigment are normal in the mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow\, spleen\, and liver\, where aging red cells are normally degraded\. __
* __Excessive deposition of hemosiderin__
  * __hemosiderosis__
  * __hereditary hemochromatosis__

# Other accumulations

__Amyloid__

__Hyaline change__

# 

__Usually\, the word hyaline is used descriptively to refer to an accumulation of pink\, glassy material\.__  __Many processes can lead to hyaline change\, including:__  __Protein accumulation \(Russell bodies and alcoholic hyaline are pink and glassy\)__

__Scarring \(fibrous tissue in old scars can look pink and glassy\)__

__Vascular changes in hypertension and diabetes \(extravasated plasma proteins and deposition of basement membrane material can give the vessel walls a  pink\, glassy appearance\)__

__Pigments \(colored substances\) are sometimes seen in histologic sections\. They can be normal or abnormal\, and they may be from the outside \(exogenous\) or made inside the body \(endogenous\)\. There are five main pigments seen within tissues\.__  __1\. Carbon \(coal dust\)__  __This is the most common exogenous pigment\. It's seen in urban dwellers\, coal miners and smokers\. The official name for the blackening of the lungs seen in these patients is anthracosis\.__  __2\. Tattoo pigment__  __Tattoo pigments are often composed of metal salts \(like iron oxide\) but vegetable dyes and plastic\-based dyes may be used too\. The pigment is phagocytosed by dermal macrophages which retain the pigment for the person's lifetime\.__  __3\. Lipofuscin__  __This pigment\, known as the wear\-and\-tear pigment\, is composed of a bunch of lipids and proteins and has a yellow\-brown appearance\. __  __Here's the awesome part\. The name lipofuscin is derived\, in part\, from the Latin word fuscus\, which means dingy\, brown\, or dark\. That's probably why "obfuscate" means "to make unclear or obscure\." This is the weird kind of thing that makes me inordinately happy\. I have no idea why finding the Latin connection between two seemingly unrelated words should make me happy in such disproportionate measure \- or happy at all \- but it does\. I try sharing this kind of thing with others but they look at me strangely and back away slightly\.__  __Happiness aside\, lipofuscin accumulates with age\, and is of no clinical significance\. __

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging21.jpg)

__4\. Melanin__  __Melanin comes from the Greek word for black \(melas\)\. This doesn't make me as happy as fuscus\. I don't know why\. It is a deep brown\-black pigment that is seen\, not surprisingly\, in melanocytes\.__  __5\. Hemosiderin__  __This yellow\-brown pigment is one of the major storage forms of iron\. It is normally seen in macrophages in the bone marrow\, spleen and liver \(which are actively breaking down red cells\)\. It is also seen when there is a local excess of iron \(as in a bruise\) or systemic excess of iron \(for example\, in patients with repeated blood transfusions\.__

# PATHOLOGIC CALCIFICATION

# Pathologic Calcification

__Abnormal deposition of calcium salts__

__Together with smaller amounts of iron\, magnesium\, and other minerals__

* __Dystrophic calcification__
  * __deposition occurs in dead or dying tissues__
  * __no defect in calcium metabolism__
  * __serum levels of calcium is normal__
* __Metastatic calcification__
  * __deposition of calcium salts in normal tissues__
  * __is almost always secondary to hypercalcemia__
* __Hypercalcemia is not a prerequisite for dystrophic calcification\, but it can exacerbate it\.__

# Dystrophic Calcification

* __In areas of necrosis of any type__
* __Atheromas of advanced atherosclerosis__
  * __intimal injury in the aorta and large arteries__
  * __characterized by accumulation of lipids__
* __may be an incidental finding__
  * __insignificant past cell injury__
* __may be a cause of organ dysfunction__
  * __aging or damaged heart valves__
  * __severely compromised valve motion__
* __Dystrophic calcification of the aortic valves is an important cause of aortic stenosis in elderly persons__

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging23.png)

# Pathogenesis of dystrophic calcification

__initiation \(or nucleation\) and propagation__

__may be either intracellular or extracellular__

__end product is crystalline calcium phosphate__

# Initiation in extracellular sites

* __Occurs in membrane\-bound vesicles about 200 nm in diameter__
  * __in normal cartilage and bone they are known as matrix vesicles__
  * __in pathologic calcification they derive from degenerating cells__
* __Calcium is initially concentrated in these vesicles by its affinity for membrane phospholipids__
* __Phosphates accumulate as a result of the action of membrane\-bound phosphatases__

# Intracellular calcification

__in the mitochondria of dead or dying cells that have lost their ability to regulate intracellular calcium__

# Propagation of crystal formation

* __depends on:__
  * __the concentration of Ca2\+ and PO4−__
  * __presence of mineral inhibitors__
  * __degree of collagenization__
    * __enhances the rate of crystal growth__

# Metastatic calcification

__Occur in normal tissues__

__There is hypercalcemia__

# Causes of hypercalcemia

* __Increased secretion of parathyroid hormone__
  * __primary parathyroid tumors__
  * __production of parathyroid hormone–related protein by other malignant tumors__

* __Destruction of bone accelerated turnover__
  * __Paget disease__
  * __immobilization__
  * __tumors__
    * __increased bone catabolism__
    * __multiple myeloma__
    * __leukemia__
    * __diffuse skeletal metastases__

* __Vitamin D–related disorders__
  * __vitamin D intoxication__
  * __sarcoidosis__
    * __macrophages activate a vitamin D precursor__

* __Renal failure__
  * __Phosphate retention leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism__

# Morphology of Calcification

* __White granules or clumps\, often felt as gritty deposits__
* __Dystrophic calcification is common in caseous necrosis in tuberculosis__
  * __tuberculous lymph node is seen as a radiopaque stone__

# Morphology

__intracellular and/or extracellular basophilic deposits__

__Heterotopic bone may be formed in the focus of calcification\.__

# CELLULAR AGING

# Why do we age?

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging25.jpg)

__Underwood's Pathology: A Clinical Approach \, Sixth Edition__

* __Individuals age\, because their cells age__
* __aging is regulated by a limited number of genes and signaling pathways__
  * __observed from yeast to mammals__

# DNA damage

__Metabolic insults that accumulate over time__

__Result in damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA__

__Most DNA damage is repaired by DNA repair enzymes__

__Some persists and accumulates as cells age__

__Aging syndromes are associated with defects in DNA repair mechanisms__

__Life span of experimental animals can be increased if responses to DNA damage are enhanced or proteins that stabilize DNA are introduced__

__Role of free radicals remains controversial__

__a small section of the telomere is not duplicated\, and telomeres become progressively shortened__

__the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken DNA__

__signals cell cycle arrest__

![](img%5CIntracellular-Accumulations-Cellular-Aging26.png)

# Telomerase

__Telomere length is maintained by nucleotide addition__

__a specialized RNA\-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template for adding nucleotides to the ends of chromosomes__

# Telomerase activity

* __present in germ cells__
* __present at low levels in stem cells__
* __absent in most somatic tissues__
