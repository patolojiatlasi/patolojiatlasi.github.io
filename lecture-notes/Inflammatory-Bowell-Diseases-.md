# IBD

* __More common in females__
* __Frequently present during adolescence or in young adults__
* __Most common among whites__
* __3\-5x more eastern European \(Ashkenazi\) Jews__
* __Most prevalent in North America\, northern Europe\, and Australia__
* __IBD incidence worldwide is on the rise__
* __Hygiene hypothesis__
  * __related to improved food storage conditions__
  * __decreased food contamination__
  * __reduced frequency of enteric infections due to improved hygiene__
  * __resulted in inadequate development of regulatory processes that limit mucosal immune responses early in life__
  * __inappropriate immune responses__

# The cause(s) of IBD remains uncertain

__Combination of errant host interactions with intestinal microbiota__

__Intestinal epithelial dysfunction__

__Aberrant mucosal immune responses__

# Genetics

* __Risk of disease is increased when there is an affected family member__
* __Concordance rate for monozygotic twins__
  * __Crohn disease 50%__
  * __Ulcerative colitis 16%__

* __NOD2 \(nucleotide oligomerization binding domain 2\)__
  * __susceptibility gene in Crohn disease__
  * __Protein that binds to intracellular bacterial peptidoglycans and subsequently activates NF\-κB__
  * __Disease\-associated NOD2 variants are less effective at recognizing and combating luminal microbes__
    * __Microbes enter the lamina propria and trigger inflammatory reactions__
  * __NOD2 prevent excessive activation by luminal microbes__
* __Disease develops in less than 10% of persons carrying NOD2 mutations__
* __NOD2 mutations are uncommon in African and Asian patients with Crohn disease__

* __ATG16L1 \(autophagy\-related 16–like\-1\)__
  * __autophagosome pathway__
  * __critical to host cell responses to intracellular bacteria__
* __IRGM \(immunity\-related GTPase M\)__
  * __involved in autophagy and clearance of intracellular bacteria__
* __None of these genes are associated with ulcerative colitis__

# Mucosal immune responses

* __Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents remain mainstays of IBD therapy__
* __Polarization of helper T cells to the TH1 type in Crohn disease__
* __TH17  contribute to disease pathogenesis__
* __Polymorphisms of the IL\-23 receptor confer protection from Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis__
  * __IL\-23 is involved in the development and maintenance of TH17 cells__
* __anti\-TNF therapy effective in some patients with ulcerative colitis__

__In ulcerative colitis significant TH2__

__Mucosal IL\-13 production is increased in ulcerative colitis\, Crohn disease__

__Polymorphisms of the IL\-10 gene\, IL10 receptor gene\, have been linked to ulcerative colitis but not Crohn disease__

# Epithelial defects

* __Defects in intestinal epithelial tight junction barrier function__
  * __in patients with Crohn disease and a subset of their healthy first\-degree relatives__
    * __NOD2 polymorphisms__
  * __experimental models__
    * __activate innate and adaptive mucosal immunity__
* __Paneth cell granules__
  * __contain antimicrobial peptides that can affect composition of the luminal microbiota__
  * __abnormal in patients with Crohn disease carrying ATG16L1 mutations__

# Microbiota

* __Intestinal microbiota contribute to IBD pathogenesis__
  * __Metronidazole\, can be helpful in maintenance of remission in Crohn disease__
  * __Probiotic bacteria may be used for treatment__
  * __Fecal transplantation__
  * __A single episode of appendicitis is associated with reduced risk of developing ulcerative colitis__
* __Risk of Crohn disease is increased by smoking__
  * __whereas ulcerative colitis is reduced__

__Relapsing disorder__

__Attacks of bloody diarrhea__

__Expulsion of stringy\, mucoid material__

__Colectomy cures intestinal disease\, but extraintestinal manifestations may persist__

# Indeterminate Colitis

__Histopathologic and clinical overlap between ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease is common__

__Not possible to make a distinction in up to 10% of patients with IBD__

# Colitis-Associated Neoplasia

* __Long\-term complications of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn disease__
* __Begins as dysplasia__
  * __Low grade__
    * __treated with colectomy or monitored closely__
  * __High grade__
    * __associated with invasive carcinoma at the same site or elsewhere in the colon__
    * __colectomy__

__Risk of dysplasia:__

__Risk increases sharply 8 to 10 years after disease initiation__

__Pancolitis are at greater risk than those with only left\-sided disease\.__

__Greater frequency and severity of active inflammation \(characterized by the presence of neutrophils\) may increase risk__

__Patients enrolled in surveillance programs approximately 8 years after diagnosis of IBD__

__If there is primary sclerosing cholangitis screen at time of diagnosis__
