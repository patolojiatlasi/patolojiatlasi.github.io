# RATE OF GROWTH

# How long does it take to produce a clinically overt tumor mass?

* __Original transformed cell__
* __30 population doublings__
* __10__  __9__  __ cells \(1 gm\)__
  * __smallest clinically detectable mass__
* __10 additional doubling cycles__
* __10__  __12__  __ cells \(∼1 kg\)__
  * __maximal size compatible with life\.__

__Until we detect it\, tumor completed most of its lifespan__

# Rate of Growth

* __Most benign tumors grow slowly__
  * __months to years__
* __Mitoses are usually rare and have normal configuration\.__
* __Most cancers grow much faster\, eventually spreading locally and to distant sites \(metastasizing\) and causing death__

* __Some benign tumors grow more rapidly than some cancers__
* __Leiomyoma growth rate depend on circulating estrogen levels__
  * __Increase rapidly in size during pregnancy\, then stop growing\, become largely fibrocalcific\, after menopause__
* __Blood supply or pressure affect growth of benign tumors__
  * __Adenomas of the pituitary gland locked into the sella turcica  may shrink suddenly\. A wave of necrosis as progressive enlargement compresses their blood supply__

* __In malignant tumors growth rate correlates inversely with differentiation__
  * __Poorly differentiated tumors grow more rapidly__
* __Wide variation in the rate of growth__
  * __Grow slowly for years\, enter a phase of rapid growth__
  * __Emergence of an aggressive subclone__
* __Some grow relatively slowly and steadily__
  * __More G1 cells than S or M phase cells__
* __Growth may come almost to a standstill__
  * __almost all G1__
* __Some primary tumors \(choriocarcinomas\) become totally necrotic\, leaving only secondary metastatic implants__

![](img%5CCharacteristics-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Neoplasmspptx-kopyas%C4%B124.png)

__Robbins and Cotran’s Pathological Basis of Diseases__

# Rate of Growth depends on

__the doubling time of tumor cells__

__the fraction of tumor cells that are in the replicative pool__

__the rate at which cells are shed or die__

# Rate of Growth is determined by

* __Counting mitosis under microscope__
* __Detecting tumor cells preparing to divide__
  * __Ki\-67 labelling index__
  * __PCNA stains__

# Rate of Growth and Necrosis

__Rapidly growing malignant tumors contain central areas of ischemic necrosis__

__Tumor blood supply fails to keep pace with the oxygen demand__

__In benign tumors necrosis may occur\, degenerative type necrosis__

__In malignant tumor necrosis is abrupt\, tumor necrosis__

# LOCAL INVASION

# Local invasion is not seen in benign tumors

* __Benign neoplasm remains localized at its site of origin__
* __Does not have the capacity to infiltrate\, invade\, or metastasize to distant sites__
* __Separated from normal tissue with well defined border__
* __Adenomas slowly expand__
* __Develop an enclosing fibrous capsule__
  * __Separates them from the host tissue__

# Tumor Capsule

* __Derived from__
  * __the stroma of the host tissue__
    * __via pressure atrophy__
  * __the stroma of the tumor__
* __Not all benign neoplasms are encapsulated__
  * __Leiomyoma__
    * __demarcated from the surrounding smooth muscle by a zone of compressed and attenuated normal myometrium\, no well\-developed capsule\. __
* __Few benign tumors are neither encapsulated nor discretely defined__
  * __some benign vascular neoplasms of the dermis__
* __Lack of a capsule does not mean that a tumor is malignant__

# Local Invasion in Malignant Tumors

* __Malignant tumor growth pattern:__
  * __Progressive infiltration__
  * __Invasion__
  * __Destruction__
  * __Penetration of the surrounding tissue__
  * __Do not develop well\-defined capsules__
    * __Slowly growing malignant tumors have stroma around them__
    * __There are tiny penetrating foci into adjacent structures__

__Malignant tumors should be removed with a wide margin of surrounding normal tissue because of this growth pattern__

__Surgical pathologists examine the margins of resected tumors to ensure that they are devoid of cancer cells \(clean margins\)__

__Like metastases\, local invasiveness is the most reliable feature that distinguishes malignant from benign tumors__

# METASTASIS

# Metastasis

__Secondary implants of a tumor__

__Discontinuous with the primary tumor__

__Located in remote tissues__

![](img%5CCharacteristics-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Neoplasmspptx-kopyas%C4%B134.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

* __Property of metastasis identifies a neoplasm as malignant__
* __Not all cancers have equivalent ability to metastasize__
  * __Basal cell carcinomas of the skin and most primary tumors of the central nervous system\, which are highly invasive locally but rarely metastasize__
  * __Osteogenic \(bone\) sarcomas\, usually have metastasized to the lungs at the time of initial discovery__

__30% of patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors present with clinically evident metastases__

__20% have occult \(hidden\) metastases at the time of diagnosis__

__The more anaplastic and the larger the primary neoplasm\, the more likely is metastatic spread__

# Invasion and Spread

* __Malignant tumors invade normal structures and spread__
* __Lymphatic__
* __Capillary\, Vein__
* __Spaces__
  * __Peritoneum\, Pleura__
  * __Cerebrospinal Fluid__
* __Perineural space \(cause local invasion\)__

# Spread on body cavities

* __Ovarian tumors__
  * __Spread on peritoneum__
  * __Reimplant on other structures__
    * __This feature is different than local invasion__
* __Tumors of CNS \(Medulloclastoma\, Ependymoma\)__
  * __Spread via CSF__
  * __Implant on meningeal surfaces or spinal cord__

# Lymphatic spread

* __Epithelial tumors__
* __Metastasis develop in lymph nodes__
  * __Drainage sites__
  * __Local lymph nodes__
* __Not all enlarged lymph nodes are metastatic__
  * __hyperplasia of the follicles \(lymphadenitis\)__
  * __Proliferation of macrophages in the subcapsular sinuses \(sinus histiocytosis\)__

__Pathology \- The Big Picture__

* __Lung carcinoma__
  * __Regional bronchial lymph nodes and then to the tracheobronchial and hilar nodes__
* __Breast carcinoma__
  * __Upper outer quadrant→ axillary lymph nodes__
  * __Lower inner quadrant → chest wall\, internal mammarian__
* __Both of them then go to infraclavicular and supraclavicular lymph nodes__

# Skip Metastasis

__Do not follow usual route__

__Miss one lymph node and develop metastasis in the next one__

# Sentinel lymph node

__The first lymph node the tumor goes to__

__May be detected with certain dyes and radioactive methods__

# Hematogenous spread

* __Mesenchymal and Epithelial tumors__
* __Mostly veins__
* __Follow the venous route__
  * __Abdomen → Liver__
  * __All veins → Lung__
  * __Throid\, prostate → paravertebral plexus → vertebra__

![](img%5CCharacteristics-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Neoplasmspptx-kopyas%C4%B136.png)

__Rubin’s Pathology 7th Ed__

* __Some tumors grow in veins:__
  * __Renal Cell Carcinoma__
    * __Via inferior vena cava grow into heart__
  * __Hepatocellular Carcinoma__

# Not all metastasis can be explained anatomically

__Prostate carcinoma goes to bone__

__Bronchogenic carcinoma goes to adrenals\, brain__

__Neuroblastoma goes to liver\, bone__

__Skeletal muscle have abundant vascular structures but not a place for metastasis__

__Homing of tumor cells__

__What we talk in this lecture are generic statements\.__

__Some “benign” tumors may cause death\, so they are clinically not benign at all\.__

__Some “very malignant” tumors respond to therapy more quickly\.__

__Some well\-differentiated tumors do not respond to therapy\.__
