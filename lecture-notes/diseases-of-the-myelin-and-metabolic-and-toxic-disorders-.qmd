# Diseases of the Myelin, Metabolic and Toxic Disorders

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# PRIMARY DISEASES OF MYELIN

# Myelin

__Axons are tightly ensheathed by myelin__

__Electrical insulator that allows rapid propagation of neural impulses__

__Consists of multiple layers of highly specialized\, closely apposed plasma membranes__

__Assembled by oligodendrocytes__

__Myelinated axons are present in all areas of the brain__

__Dominant component in the white matter__

__Diseases of myelin are primarily white matter disorders__

__Most diseases of CNS myelin do not involve the peripheral nerves to any significant extent\, and vice versa__

# Myelin in peripheral nerves

* __Differences of myelin in the CNS and PNS__
* __Peripheral myelin is made by Schwann cells\, not oligodendrocytes__
* __Each Schwann cell in a peripheral nerve provides myelin for only one internode__
  * __in the CNS\, many internodes are created by processes coming from a single oligodendrocyte__
* __Specialized proteins and lipids are also different__
* __Most diseases of CNS myelin do not involve the peripheral nerves to any significant extent\, and vice versa__

# Diseases involving myelin

* __Demyelinating diseases of the CNS__
  * __Acquired conditions__
  * __Preferential damage to previously normal myelin__
  * __Most common diseases in this group result from immune\-mediated injury__
    * __multiple sclerosis \(MS\) and related disorders__
  * __Viral infection of oligodendrocytes__
    * __multifocal leukoencephalopathy__
  * __injury caused by drugs and other toxic agents__

* __Dysmyelinating diseases \(Leukodystrophy\)__
  * __Myelin is not formed properly__
  * __Has abnormal turnover kinetics__
  * __Mutations that disrupt the function of proteins that are required for the formation of normal myelin sheaths__

# DEMYELINATING DISEASES

# Multiple Sclerosis

* __Autoimmune demyelinating disorder__
* __Distinct episodes of neurologic deficits\, separated in time\, attributable to white matter lesions that are separated in space__
* __Most common demyelinating disorder__
  * __1/1000 persons in most of the United States and Europe__
* __May become clinically apparent at any age__
  * __onset in childhood or >50 is rare__
* __F:M=2:1__
* __Relapsing and remitting episodes of neurologic impairment__
  * __frequency of relapses tends to decrease during the course of the illness__
* __A steady neurologic deterioration is characteristic in a subset of patients__

* __Combination of environmental and genetic factors__
* __Loss of tolerance to self myelin antigens__
* __Initiating agent\, an infectious agent?__
* __15x higher when in first\-degree relative__
* __Concordance rate for monozygotic twins 25%__
  * __much lower rate for dizygotic twins__
* __HLA\-DR2 most significantly increases the risk for developing MS__
* __Polymorphisms in the genes cytokines IL\-2 and IL\-7__
  * __activation and regulation of T cell–mediated immune responses__

__Prominent chronic inflammatory cells within and around MS plaques__

__Genetic evidence__

__→ Immune\-mediated myelin destruction have a central role__

__Central role for CD4\+ T cells__

__Increase in TH17 and TH1 CD4\+ cells__

__CD8\+ T cells and B cells__

* __Sometimes axonal degeneration occurs__
  * __Toxic effects of lymphocytes\, macrophages\, and their secreted molecules__
  * __May cause neuronal death__

__Multiple Sclerosis__

__White matter disease__

__Affected areas showing multiple\, well\-circumscribed\, slightly depressed\, glassy\-appearing\, gray\-tan\, irregularly shaped lesions__

__Plaques__

__Commonly arise near the ventricles__

__Frequent in the optic nerves and chiasm\, brain stem\, ascending and descending fiber tracts\, cerebellum\, and spinal cord__

# Clinical course of MS

__The clinical course is variable__

__Multiple relapses followed by episodes of remission__

__Recovery during remissions is not complete__

__Over time there is usually a gradual\, often stepwise\, accumulation of neurologic deficits__

__Imaging studies have demonstrated that there are often more lesions in the brains of patients with MS than might be expected from the clinical examination__

__Lesions can come and go much more often than was previously suspected__

* __Changes in cognitive function can be present__
  * __Much milder than the other deficits__
* __It is hard to predict when the next relapse will occur__
* __CSF examination__
  * __A mildly elevated protein level__
  * __Increased proportion of immunoglobulin__
    * __Oligoclonal bands__
    * __Antibodies are directed against a variety of antigenic targets__
  * __1/3 moderate pleocytosis__

# Other Acquired Demyelinating Diseases

* __Immune\-mediated demyelination after systemic infectious illnesses__
  * __even mild viral diseases__
* __Not related to direct spread of the infectious agents to the nervous system__
  * __Immune cells responding to pathogen\-associated antigens cross react against myelin antigens → myelin damage__

# Postinfectious autoimmune reactions to myelin

* __Associated with acute\-onset monophasic illnesses__
* __Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis__
  * __Symptoms typically develop a week or two after an antecedent infection__
  * __Nonlocalizing \(headache\, lethargy\, and coma\)__
    * __In contrast with the focal findings of MS__
  * __Symptoms progress rapidly__
  * __Fatal in 20% of cases__
  * __Others recover completely__
* __Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis__
  * __More devastating disorder__
  * __Typically affects young adults and children__

# Neuromyelitis optica

__Inflammatory demyelinating disease__

__Centered on the optic nerves and spinal cord__

__Antibody\-mediated autoimmune disorder__

__Antibodies to the water channel aquaporin\-4 are both diagnostic and pathogenic__

# Central pontine myelinolysis

* __Nonimmune process__
* __Loss of myelin involving the center of the pons__
* __Rapid correction of hyponatremia__
* __Mechanism of oligodendroglial cell injury is uncertain__
* __May be related to edema induced by sudden changes in osmotic pressure__
* __Alcoholism and severe electrolyte or osmolar imbalance__
* __Similar lesions can be found elsewhere in the brain__

__Occurs after reactivation of JC virus in immunosuppressed patients__

# DYSMYELINATING DISEASES (LEUKODYSTROPHY)

# Leukodystrophies

__Inherited dysmyelinating diseases__

__Clinical symptoms derive from abnormal myelin synthesis or turnover__

__Lysosomal enzymes__

__Peroxisomal enzymes__

__Mutations in myelin proteins__

__Most are autosomal recessive inheritance__

__X\-linked diseases also occur__
