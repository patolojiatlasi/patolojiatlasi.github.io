# Central Nervous System

* __Rigid skull and spinal canal__
* __Specific foramina__

* __Advantage of protection__
* __But cannot expand__
  * __generalized cerebral edema\, hydrocephalus\, mass lesions\, tumors__

# EDEMA

![](img%5CCerebrovascular-diseasespptx-kopyas%C4%B11.png)

# Cerebral Edema

* __Accumulation of excess fluid within the brain parenchyma__
* __Vasogenic edema__
  * __Integrity of the normal blood\-brain barrier is disrupted__
  * __Fluid shift from the vascular compartment into the extracellular spaces of the brain__
  * __Localized__
    * __increased vascular permeability due to inflammation\, tumors__
  * __Generalized__
* __Cytotoxic edema__
  * __Increase in intracellular fluid__
  * __Neuronal and glial cell membrane injury__
  * __Generalized hypoxic\-ischemic insult\, exposure to some toxins__

__Edematous brain__

__Softer than normal__

__Appears to “over fill” the cranial vault__

__In generalized edema gyri are flattened\, the intervening sulci are narrowed\, and the ventricular cavities are compressed__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

![](img%5CCerebrovascular-diseasespptx-kopyas%C4%B13.png)

__Cerebral edema__

__Gyri are flattened as a result of compression of the expanding brain by the dura mater and inner surface of the skull\. Such changes are associated with a dangerous increase in intracranial pressure\.__

# HYDROCEPHALUS

![](img%5CCerebrovascular-diseasespptx-kopyas%C4%B14.png)

# Hydrocephalus

__CSF is produced by the choroid plexus within the ventricles__

__Circulates through the ventricular system__

__Flows through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie into the subarachnoid space__

__Absorbed by arachnoid granulations__

__The balance between rates of generation and resorption regulates CSF volume__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

![](img%5CCerebrovascular-diseasespptx-kopyas%C4%B16.png)

* __Accumulation of excessive CSF within the ventricular system__
* __Overproduction of CSF__
  * __Tumors of the choroid plexus__
  * __Rarely causes hydrocephalus__

![](img%5CCerebrovascular-diseasespptx-kopyas%C4%B17.png)

* __Noncommunicating hydrocephalus__
  * __Localized obstacle to CSF flow within the ventricular system__
  * __A portion of the ventricles enlarges while the remainder does not__
  * __Masses obstructing the foramen of Monro or compressing the cerebral aqueduct__
* __Communicating hydrocephalus__
  * __Entire ventricular system is enlarged__
  * __Reduced CSF resorption__

* __In infancy before closure of the cranial sutures\, the head enlarges__
* __Once the sutures fuse\, hydrocephalus causes ventricular expansion and increased intracranial pressure\, but no change in head circumference__
* __Hydrocephalus ex vacuo__
  * __A compensatory increase in CSF volume can also follow the loss of brain parenchyma after infarcts or with degenerative diseases__

# HERNIATION

# Herniation

* __Cranial vault is subdivided by rigid dural folds__
  * __falx and tentorium__
* __Intracranial pressure rises__
  * __Volume of tissue and fluid inside the skull increases beyond the limit permitted by compression of veins and displacement of CSF__

* __If the expansion is sufficiently large\, herniation occurs__
* __Herniation often leads to “pinching” and vascular compromise of the compressed tissue__
  * __infarction\, additional swelling\, and further herniation__
