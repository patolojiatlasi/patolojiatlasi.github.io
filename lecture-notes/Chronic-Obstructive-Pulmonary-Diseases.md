# Irregular Emphysema

* __Acinus is irregularly involved__
* __Associated with scarring__
* __Healed inflammatory diseases__
* __Clinically asymptomatic__
  * __Most common form of emphysema__

# Pathogenesis of Emphysema

![](img%5CChronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases17.png)

* __Exposure to toxic substances__
  * __Tobacco smoke\, inhaled pollutants__
  * __Ongoing inflammation__
  * __Accumulation of neutrophils\, macrophages and lymphocytes__
  * __Elastases\, cytokines \(IL\-8\)\, oxidants are released__
  * __Epithelial injury and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix__

# Emphysema

__Elastin degradation products increase the inflammation__

__80% of patients with congenital α1\-antitrypsin \(antielastase\) deficiency develop symptomatic panacinar emphysema__

__Earlier age and with greater severity if the affected person smokes__

__TGFB gene polymorphisms influence susceptibility to COPD__

__MMP\-9 and MMP\-12__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Emphysema__

__Fibrosing lung diseases__

* __Tissue destruction without fibrosis__
* __Loss of epithelial and endothelial cells__
* __Also loss of mesenchymal cells__
  * __Lack of extracellular matrix__
  * __Emphysema can be thought as an insufficient wound repair__

* __Tissue destruction with interstitial fibrosis __
  * __Excessive myofibroblastic or fibroblastic response to injury__
  * __Scarring__

# Airway obstruction in emphysema

* __Normally: Small airways are held open bu the elastic recoil of parenchyma__
* __Emphysema:__
  * __Loss of elastic tissue__
  * __During respiration respiratory bronchioles collapse__
  * __Functional airway obstruction occurs\, despite there is no mechanical obstruction__
  * __There is also narrowing of lumen due to ongoing chronic inflammatory changes__

# Macroscopic appearance

* __Panacinar emphysema__
  * __Pale\, voluminous lungs__
  * __Obscure the heart when the anterior chest wall is removed at autopsy__
* __Centriacinar emphysema __
  * __Upper two thirds of the lungs are more severely affected than the lower lungs__

# Histologic examination

* __Destruction of alveolar walls without fibrosis\, leading to enlarged air spaces__
* __Alveolar loss__
* __The number of alveolar capillaries is diminished__
* __Terminal and respiratory bronchioles deformed__
  * __Loss of septa__
  * __Collapse during expiration__
* __Bronchiolar inflammation and submucosal fibrosis in advanced disease__

# Conditions Related to Emphysema

* __Compensatory emphysema__
  * __Response to loss of lung substance__
  * __Surgical removal of a diseased lung or lobe__
* __Obstructive overinflation__
  * __Lung expands because air is trapped within it__
  * __Tumor or foreign object__

* __Bullous emphysema__
  * __Any form of emphysema produces large subpleural blebs or bullae__
  * __Greater than 1 cm in diameter in the distended state__
  * __May rupture\, leading to pneumothorax__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

* __Mediastinal \(interstitial\) emphysema__
  * __Air enters the connective tissue stroma of the lung\, mediastinum\, and subcutaneous tissue__
  * __Spontaneously with a sudden increase in intra\-alveolar pressure → tear → air enters into tissue__
