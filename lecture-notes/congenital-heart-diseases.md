# Congenital heart diseases

**Abnormalities of the heart or great vessels that are present at
birth**

**20-30% of all birth defects**

**6-8 of every 1000 liveborn infants**

**Incidence is higher in premature infants and in stillborns**

# Surgery

**May correct the hemodynamic abnormalities**

**Repaired heart may not be completely normal**

**Myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling may be irreversible**

**All cardiac surgery results in some degree of myocardial scarring**

**Secondary arrhythmias, ischemia, and myocardial dysfunction, appear
many years after surgical correction**

# Pathogenesis

- **Faulty embryogenesis during gestational 3-8 weeks**
- **Cause is unknown in almost 90% of cases**
- **Environmental causes**
  - **Congenital rubella infection**
  - **Teratogens**
  - **Maternal diabetes**
  - **Genetic factors are the best characterized**
    - **Familial forms of congenital heart disease**
    - **Trisomies 13, 15, 18, and 21, and Turner syndrome**

# Cardiac morphogenesis

- **Multiple genes**
  - **Commitment of progenitor cells to the myocardial lineage**
  - **Formation and looping of the heart tube**
  - **Segmentation and growth of the cardiac chambers**
  - **Cardiac valve formation**
  - **Connection of the great vessels to the heart**
  - **Mechanical force imparted by flowing pulsatile blood**
- **Multiple genes**
  - **Wnt**
  - **Vascular endothelial growth factor**
  - **Bone morphogenetic protein**
  - **Transforming growth factor-β**
  - **Fibroblast growth factor**
  - **Notch pathways**

# Shunt

**abnormal communication between chambers or blood vessels**

**Abnormal channels permit blood flow down pressure gradients from the
left (systemic) side to the right (pulmonary) side of the circulation or
vice versa**

**Malformations causing a ** *left-to-right shunt*

**Malformations causing a ** *right-to-left shunt*

**Malformations causing an ** *obstruction*

![](./img-local/Congenital-Heart-Diseases5.png)

# Left-to-right shunts

**Most common type of congenital cardiac malformation**

**Atrial septal defects**

**Ventricular septal defects**

**Patent ductus arteriosus**

**Cyanosis is not an early feature**

**Left-to-right shunting with volume and pressure overloads eventually
causes pulmonary hypertension**

**Secondarily right-sided pressures that exceed those on the left**

**Reversal of blood flow occurs, right-to-left shunting, cyanosis**

# 

**In contrast, ** *left-to-right shunts* \_\_ (e.g., ASD, VSD, and
patent ductus arteriosus \[PDA\]) increase pulmonary blood flow, but are
not \_\_ *initially* \_\_ associated with cyanosis. However,
left-to-right shunts chronically elevate both volume and pressure in the
normally low-pressure, low-resistance pulmonary circulation. To maintain
relatively normal distal pulmonary capillary and venous pressures, the
muscular pulmonary arteries (\<1 mm in diameter) initially respond by
undergoing medial hypertrophy and vasoconstriction. However, prolonged
pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction stimulates the development of
irreversible obstructive intimal lesions analogous to the arteriolar
changes seen in systemic hypertension; pulmonary arteries can even
develop frank atherosclerotic lesions (\_\_ *[Chapter
11](https://www.inkling.com/read/robbins-cotran-pathologic-basis-disease-professional-kumar-9/chapter-11/blood-vessels)*
**). The right ventricle also responds to the pulmonary vascular changes
by undergoing progressive right ventricular hypertrophy. Eventually,
pulmonary vascular resistance approaches systemic levels, and the
original left-to-right shunt becomes a right-to-left shunt that
introduces poorly oxygenated blood into the systemic circulation **
*(Eisenmenger syndrome).*
