# PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS

# Primary Lung Tumors

* __95% of primary lung tumors are carcinomas__
* __5% →__
  * __Carcinoids__
  * __Mesenchymal malignancies\, fibrosarcomas\, leiomyomas__
  * __Lymphomas__
  * __Other benign lesions__

# Pulmonary Hamartoma

* __Most common benign tumor__

  * __Small \(3 to 4 cm\)__
  * __Coin lesion on chest radiographs__
  * __Mature cartilage\,  often admixed with fat\, fibrous tissue\, and blood vessels__
