__Nasopharyngeal carcinoma\. Undifferentiated type\.__

__Large neoplastic cells are present admixed with a lymphocytic stroma\. __

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">Differential Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology</span>

# Lymphoepithelioma like carcinoma

* __The other name for undifferentiated carcinoma__
* __EBV directly infects B lymphocytes__
* __Marked proliferation of reactive T lymphocytes causes atypical lymphocytosis__
* __a striking influx of mature lymphocytes__
* __Lymphocytes are not part of the neoplastic process__
* __Large neoplastic cells in a background of reactive lymphocytes may give rise to an appearance similar to that in non\-Hodgkin lymphomas__
  * __Immunohistochemical stains may be required__

# Nasopharyngeal carcinomas

* __invade locally__
* __spread to cervical lymph nodes__
* __metastasize to distant sites__
* __radiosensitive__
* __5\-year survival rates of 50%__
  * __even for advanced cancers__

# LARYNGEAL TUMORS

# Vocal cord nodules

__Vocal cord polyps__

__smooth\, hemispherical protrusions__

__<0\.5 cm in diameter__

__Located on the true vocal cords__

__Fibrous tissue covered by stratified squamous mucosa__

__can be ulcerated from contact trauma with the other vocal cord__
