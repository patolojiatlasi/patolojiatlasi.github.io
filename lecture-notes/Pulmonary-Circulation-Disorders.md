# Pulmonary Circulation Disorders

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# PTE, HEMORRHAGE, INFARCTION

# Pulmonary Embolism

* __Blood clots occlude the large pulmonary arteries almost always embolic__
* __>95% of all pulmonary emboli arise from large deep veins of the lower legs__
  * __popliteal vein and larger veins above it__
* __Can be small and clinically silent__
* __Among hospitalized patients autopsy data 1\-30%__
  * __Severe burns\, trauma\, or fractures__

# Venous thrombosis predisposing factors

* __Prolonged bedrest__
  * __With immobilization of the legs__
* __Surgery__
  * __Orthopedic surgery\, of knee and hip__
* __Severe trauma__
  * __Burns\, multiple fractures__
* __Congestive heart failure__
* __In women\, the period around parturition or oral contraception using birth control pills with high estrogen content__
* __Disseminated cancer__
* __Primary disorders of hypercoagulability__
  * __Factor V Leiden__

# Two important consequences of PTE

* __Increase in pulmonary artery pressure__
  * __From blockage of flow__
  * __Vasospasm caused by neurogenic mechanisms__
  * __Release of mediators__
    * __Thromboxane A2\, serotonin__
* __ischemia of the downstream pulmonary parenchyma__

# Pulmonary Thromboembolism

* __Sudden increase in pulmonary artery pressure__
* __Diminished cardiac output__
* __Right\-sided heart failure__
  * __Acute cor pulmonale__
* __Death__

# Hypoxemia develops in PTE

* __Perfusion of lung zones that have become atelectatic__
  * __Alveolar collapse occurs in the ischemic areas__
  * __Reduction in surfactant production__
  * __Pain leads to reduced movement of the chest wall__
  * __Pulmonary blood flow is redirected through areas of the lung that normally are hypoventilated__
* __Decrease in cardiac output__
  * __Widening of the difference in arterial\-venous oxygen saturation__
* __Right\-to\-left shunting of blood__
  * __Patent foramen ovale\, present in 30% of normal persons__

# Ischemic necrosis in PTE

* __Ischemic necrosis \(infarction\) occur in 10% in PTE__
  * __compromise in cardiac function or bronchial circulation__
  * __that area is underventilated as a result of underlying pulmonary disease__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

# PTE

__60\-80% of emboli are clinically silent__

__Pulmonary infarction__

* __Emboli usually resolve after the initial acute event__
  * __Contract__
  * __Endogenous fibrinolytic activity__

* __Risk of recurrence is high__
  * __30% chance of developing a second__

# Infarction

* __Compromised cardiovascular status__
  * __Congestive heart failure__

* __3/4 lower lobes__
* __>1/2 are multiple__
* __Wedge\-shaped__
  * __Base at the pleural surface and the apex pointing toward the hilus__

# PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

# Pulmonary Hypertension

__Mean pulmonary pressures reach one fourth or more of systemic levels__

__Most often secondary to a decrease in the cross\-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed__

__Increased pulmonary vascular blood flow__

  * __inhibits proliferation__
  * __When mutated  → abnormal vascular endothelial and pulmonary smooth muscle proliferation__
