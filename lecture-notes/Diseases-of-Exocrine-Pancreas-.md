# Diseases of Exocrine Pancreas

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Pancreas

* __Exocrine organ__
  * __Acinar cells__
    * __Produce the digestive enzymes__
  * __Ductules and ducts__
    * __Cuboidal cells lining the smaller ductules secrete bicarbonate\-rich fluid__
    * __Columnar cells lining the larger ducts produce mucin__
    * __Larger ducts also express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator \(CFTR\)__
      * __aberrant function of this membrane protein affects the viscosity of the pancreatic secretions__
* __Endocrine organ__
  * __ islets of Langerhans__
  * __secrete insulin\, glucagon\, and somatostatin__

# İnhibitors of autodigestion of the pancreas

__Pancreatic enzymes are synthesized as inactive proenzymes__

__Sequestered in membrane\-bound zymogen granules__

__Activation of proenzymes requires conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin by duodenal enteropeptidase \(enterokinase\)__

__Trypsin inhibitors \(e\.g\.\, SPINK1\, also known as pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor\) are secreted by acinar and ductal cells__

__Trypsin cleaves and inactivates itself__

__Acinar cells are remarkably resistant to the action of activated enzymes__

# Cystic Fibrosis
