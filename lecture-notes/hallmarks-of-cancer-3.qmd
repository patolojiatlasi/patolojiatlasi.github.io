# Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer Syndrome

__Familial carcinomas of the cecum and proximal colon__

__Defects in genes of DNA mismatch repair__

__When DNA is repaired\, these genes act as “spell checkers\.”__

__Without them errors accumulate at an increased rate__

__Microsatellite instability \(MSI\) occurs__

# Xeroderma Pigmentosum

__Ultraviolet rays in sunlight cause cross\-linking of pyrimidine residues__

__Prevent normal DNA replication__

__Inherited loss of this repair causes many skin tumors__

# Diseases with Defects in DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination

__Autosomal recessive__

__Hypersensitivity to other DNA\-damaging agents__

__Ionizing radiation \(in Bloom syndrome and ataxia\-telangiectasia\)__

__DNA cross\-linking agents\, such as nitrogen mustard \(in Fanconi anemia\)__

# BRCA1 and BRCA2

__DNA repair genes__

__When activitiy is lost leads to Hereditary and sporadic breast and ovarian tumors__

__Genes involved in homologous recombination DNA repair pathway __

__Hereditary breast cancer__

__Women with BRCA1 mutations higher risk of epithelial ovarian cancers\, and men have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer__

__Mutations in the BRCA2 gene increase the risk of breast cancer in both men and women\, as well as cancer of the ovary\, prostate\, pancreas\, bile ducts\, stomach\, melanocytes\, and B lymphocytes__

# Cancers Resulting From Mutations Induced by Regulated Genomic Instability: Lymphoid Neoplasms

__A special type of DNA damage plays a central role in the pathogenesis of tumors of B and T lymphocytes\. As described earlier\, adaptive immunity relies on the ability of B and T cells to diversify their antigen receptor genes\. Early B and T cells both express a pair of gene products\, RAG1 and RAG2\, that carry out V\(D\)J segment recombination\, permitting the assembling of functional antigen receptor genes\. In addition\, after encountering antigen\, mature B cells express a specialized enzyme called activation\-induced cytosine deaminase \(AID\)\, which catalyzes both immunoglobulin gene class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation__
