# IBD

- **More common in females**
- **Frequently present during adolescence or in young adults**
- **Most common among whites**
- **3-5x more eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jews**
- **Most prevalent in North America, northern Europe, and Australia**
- **IBD incidence worldwide is on the rise**
- **Hygiene hypothesis**
  - **related to improved food storage conditions**
  - **decreased food contamination**
  - **reduced frequency of enteric infections due to improved hygiene**
  - **resulted in inadequate development of regulatory processes that
    limit mucosal immune responses early in life**
  - **inappropriate immune responses**

# The cause(s) of IBD remains uncertain

**Combination of errant host interactions with intestinal microbiota**

**Intestinal epithelial dysfunction**

**Aberrant mucosal immune responses**

# Genetics

- **Risk of disease is increased when there is an affected family
  member**

- **Concordance rate for monozygotic twins**

  - **Crohn disease 50%**
  - **Ulcerative colitis 16%**

- **NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization binding domain 2)**

  - **susceptibility gene in Crohn disease**
  - **Protein that binds to intracellular bacterial peptidoglycans and
    subsequently activates NF-κB**
  - **Disease-associated NOD2 variants are less effective at recognizing
    and combating luminal microbes**
    - **Microbes enter the lamina propria and trigger inflammatory
      reactions**
  - **NOD2 prevent excessive activation by luminal microbes**

- **Disease develops in less than 10% of persons carrying NOD2
  mutations**

- **NOD2 mutations are uncommon in African and Asian patients with Crohn
  disease**

- **ATG16L1 (autophagy-related 16–like-1)**

  - **autophagosome pathway**
  - **critical to host cell responses to intracellular bacteria**

- **IRGM (immunity-related GTPase M)**

  - **involved in autophagy and clearance of intracellular bacteria**

- **None of these genes are associated with ulcerative colitis**

# Mucosal immune responses

- **Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents remain mainstays of
  IBD therapy**
- **Polarization of helper T cells to the TH1 type in Crohn disease**
- **TH17 contribute to disease pathogenesis**
- **Polymorphisms of the IL-23 receptor confer protection from Crohn
  disease and ulcerative colitis**
  - **IL-23 is involved in the development and maintenance of TH17
    cells**
- **anti-TNF therapy effective in some patients with ulcerative
  colitis**

**In ulcerative colitis significant TH2**

**Mucosal IL-13 production is increased in ulcerative colitis, Crohn
disease**

**Polymorphisms of the IL-10 gene, IL10 receptor gene, have been linked
to ulcerative colitis but not Crohn disease**

# Epithelial defects

- **Defects in intestinal epithelial tight junction barrier function**
  - **in patients with Crohn disease and a subset of their healthy
    first-degree relatives**
    - **NOD2 polymorphisms**
  - **experimental models**
    - **activate innate and adaptive mucosal immunity**
- **Paneth cell granules**
  - **contain antimicrobial peptides that can affect composition of the
    luminal microbiota**
  - **abnormal in patients with Crohn disease carrying ATG16L1
    mutations**

# Microbiota

- **Intestinal microbiota contribute to IBD pathogenesis**
  - **Metronidazole, can be helpful in maintenance of remission in Crohn
    disease**
  - **Probiotic bacteria may be used for treatment**
  - **Fecal transplantation**
  - **A single episode of appendicitis is associated with reduced risk
    of developing ulcerative colitis**
- **Risk of Crohn disease is increased by smoking**
  - **whereas ulcerative colitis is reduced**

# Crohn Disease

- **Regional enteritis**
- **May occur in any area of the gastrointestinal tract**
- **Most common sites**
  - **Terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum**
- **Limited to the small intestine alone 40% **
- **Small intestine and the colon both are involved in 30%**
- **Others are characterized by colonic involvement only**
- **Multiple, separate, sharply delineated areas of disease**
- **Skip lesions**
- **Strictures are common**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Earliest lesion**
  - **Aphthous ulcer**
- **Multiple lesions often coalesce into elongated, serpentine ulcers**
- **Oriented along the axis of the bowel**
- **Edema and loss of normal mucosal folds are common**
- **Sparing of interspersed mucosa**

**Early lesion of the ileum showing hyperemia and focal ulceration**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases10.png)

**Chronic lesion involving the ileum**

**Sharp demarcation between the normal area on the right and the
involved area on the left**

**Narrowing of the lumen, thickening of the intestinal wall, and
coarsely textured (“cobblestone”) mucosa with fissures**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

- **Fissures frequently develop between mucosal folds**
- **Extend deeply to become sites of perforation or fistula tracts**
- **Intestinal wall is thickened as a consequence of transmural edema,
  inflammation, submucosal fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the muscularis
  propria**
  - **contribute to stricture formation**

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases11.png)

**Extensive transmural disease**

**Mesenteric fat frequently extends around the serosal surface**

**creeping fat**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Active Crohn disease

**Abundant neutrophils infiltrate and damage crypt epithelium**

**Clusters of neutrophils within a crypt crypt abscess**

**Crypt destruction**

**Ulceration is common**

**Abrupt transition between ulcerated and normal mucosa**

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases12.png)

**Repeated cycles of crypt destruction and regeneration**

**-distortion of mucosal architecture**

**-Normally straight and parallel crypts take on bizarre branching
shapes and unusual orientations to one another**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Crohn disease

- **Epithelial metaplasia**
  - **chronic relapsing injury**
- **Gastric antral-appearing glands**
  - **pseudopyloric metaplasia**
- **Paneth cell metaplasia**
  - **occur in the left colon**
- **Architectural and metaplastic changes may persist even when active
  inflammation has resolved**
- **Mucosal atrophy, with loss of crypts, may result after years of
  disease**

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases13.png)

**Noncaseating granulomas**

**-Hallmark of Crohn disease**

**-Found in approximately 35% of cases**

**-Arise in areas of active disease or uninvolved regions**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases14.png)

**Noncaseating granulomas**

**-In any layer of the intestinal wall**

**-May be found in mesenteric lymph nodes**

**-Cutaneous granulomas**

**--form nodules**

**--misnomer: metastatic Crohn disease**

# Ulcerative Colitis

- **Limited to the colon and rectum**
- **Extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis overlap with
  Crohn disease**
  - **migratory polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, ankylosing spondylitis,
    uveitis, skin lesions, pericholangitis, and primary sclerosing
    cholangitis.**
- **Always involves the rectum**
- **Extends proximally in a continuous fashion**
- **Involve part or all of the colon**
- **Skip lesions are not seen**

**Disease of the entire colon is termed pancolitis**

**Total colectomy with pancolitis showing active disease, with red,
granular mucosa in the cecum (left) and smooth, atrophic mucosa distally
(right). **

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases21.png)

**broad-based ulceration of the colonic mucosa of the distal colon**

**Pseudopolyps**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

- **Ulcerative proctitis**
  - **Disease limited to the rectum**
- **Ulcerative proctosigmoiditis**
  - **Disease limited to rectosigmoid**
- **Small intestine is normal**
  - **Mild mucosal inflammation of the distal ileum, backwash ileitis,
    may be present in severe cases of pancolitis**

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases22.png)

**Involved colonic mucosa may be slightly red and granular-appearing or
exhibit extensive broad-based ulcers**

**The transition between diseased and uninvolved colon can be abrupt**

**Sharp demarcation between active ulcerative colitis (bottom) and
normal (top)**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Ulcers are aligned along the long axis of the colon**
- **Pseudopolyps**
  - **Isolated islands of regenerating mucosa often bulge into the lumen
    to create small elevations**
- **Chronic disease may lead to mucosal atrophy**
- **Flat, smooth mucosal surface lacking normal folds**
- **Unlike in Crohn disease**
  - **mural thickening is absent**
  - **serosal surface is normal**
  - **strictures do not occur**
- **Toxic megacolon**
  - **Inflammation and inflammatory mediators can damage the muscularis
    propria**
  - **Disturb neuromuscular function**
  - **Colonic dilation**
  - **Significant risk of perforation**

# Histologic features of Ulcerative Colitis

![](img%5CInflammatory-Bowell-Diseases23.png)

- **Similar to those in colonic Crohn disease**
  - **inflammatory infiltrates**
  - **crypt abscesses**
  - **crypt distortion**
  - **epithelial metaplasia**
- **Different from Crohn**
  - **skip lesions are absent**
  - **inflammation generally is limited to the mucosa and superficial
    submucosa**
  - **Granulomas are not present**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Ulcerative Colitis

- **In severe cases**
  - **Mucosal damage may be accompanied by ulcers that extend more
    deeply into the submucosa**
  - **Muscularis propria is rarely involved**
- **Submucosal fibrosis, mucosal atrophy, and distorted mucosal
  architecture remain as residua of healed disease**
- **Histologic pattern also may revert to near normal after prolonged
  remission**

**Relapsing disorder**

**Attacks of bloody diarrhea**

**Expulsion of stringy, mucoid material**

**Colectomy cures intestinal disease, but extraintestinal manifestations
may persist**

# Indeterminate Colitis

**Histopathologic and clinical overlap between ulcerative colitis and
Crohn disease is common**

**Not possible to make a distinction in up to 10% of patients with IBD**

# Colitis-Associated Neoplasia

- **Long-term complications of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn
  disease**
- **Begins as dysplasia**
  - **Low grade**
    - **treated with colectomy or monitored closely**
  - **High grade**
    - **associated with invasive carcinoma at the same site or elsewhere
      in the colon**
    - **colectomy**

**Risk of dysplasia:**

**Risk increases sharply 8 to 10 years after disease initiation**

**Pancolitis are at greater risk than those with only left-sided
disease.**

**Greater frequency and severity of active inflammation (characterized
by the presence of neutrophils) may increase risk**

**Patients enrolled in surveillance programs approximately 8 years after
diagnosis of IBD**

**If there is primary sclerosing cholangitis screen at time of
diagnosis**
