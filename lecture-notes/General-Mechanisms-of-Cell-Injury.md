# Homeostasis

* __A happy normal cell__
  * __Comfortable__
    * __Suitable environment for function and differentiation__
  * __Neighbours and neighbourhood__
    * __Interaction with other cells__
  * __Good income__
    * __Available metabolic substrates__
  * __Can deal with daily problems__
    * __Physiologic demands__
  * __No enemy__

* __A normal cardiac cell__
  * __Comfortable__
    * __Suitable environment for contraction__
  * __Neighbours__
    * __Can interact with vascular supply\, nerves and other cells__
  * __Good income__
    * __Oxygen and glucose is readily available__
  * __Can deal with daily problems__
    * __Can pump faster if necessary__
  * __No enemy__
    * __No organisms \(Toxoplasmosis\)\, or autoimmune activity__

# Adaptations

__Reversible__

__Functional and structural responses__

__More severe physiologic stresses__

__Pathologic stimuli__

__A new steady state is achieved\. __

__Continue to function__

# Type of adaptations

* __Hypertrophy__
  * __Increase in size of the cells__
  * __Increase in proteins\, increase in function__
* __Hyperplasia__
  * __Increase in number of cells__
* __Atrophy__
  * __Decrease in size and metabolic activity of the cell__
* __Metaplasia__
  * __Change in cell phenotype__

# If cell cannot adapt

__If adaptive capability is exceeded__

__Or the stress is very harmfull__

__If stress is severe__

__Persistent__

__Rapid onset__

__Irreversible Injury__

# Cell Death

* __Many causes__
  * __ischemia \(lack of blood flow\)__
  * __Infections__
  * __Toxins__
  * __Immune reactions__
* __It is also a “normal” process__
  * __Remember embriology?__
  * __GIS epitheium regenerates every week__

# ALTERED PHYSIOLOGICAL STIMULISOME NONLETHAL INJURIOUS STIMULI

| Stimulus | Adaptation |
| :-: | :-: |
| Increased demand, increased stimulation (e.g., by growth factors, hormones)  | Hyperplasia, hypertrophy |
| Decreased nutrients, decreased stimulation  | Atrophy |
| Chronic irritation (physical or chemical)  | Metaplasia  |

__Adapted from Table 1\-1\, from Robbins__

# REDUCED OXYGEN SUPPLYCHEMICAL INJURYMICROBIAL INFECTION

| Stimulus | Injury |
| :-: | :-: |
| Acute and transient  | Acute reversible injuryCellular swelling fatty change<br /> |
| Progressive and severe (including DNA damage) | Irreversible injury → cell deathNecrosisApoptosis |
|  |  |

__Adapted from Table 1\-1\, from Robbins__

# 

| Stimulus | Response |
| :-: | :-: |
| Metabolic alterations, genetic or acquired; chronic injury | Intracellular accumulations; calcification |
| Cumulative sublethal injury over long life span | Cellular aging |

# Cardiac muscle cells

__Increased demand __

__to pump more and MORE__

__Decrease O__  __2__  __ supply__

__Increased demand __

__to pump more__

![](img%5CGeneral-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Injury1.jpg)

__Atherosclerosis__

__ischemia__

__Muscle adapts__

__Increases functional units \(proteins\)__

__Adapts→hypertrophy__

__Cell cannot aford the demand__

__Ischemia__

__Cell death__

![](img%5CGeneral-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Injury2.jpg)

__Remember\!__

__Adaptation is good\. But for a certain time\.__

__Adapted cell is functioning\, but not as good as it used to be\.__

__Adapted cell is more vulnerable to injury\.__

# Adaptations

* __Physiologic__
  * __normal stimulation by hormones or endogenous chemical mediators__
  * __the hormone\-induced enlargement of the breast and uterus during pregnancy__
* __Pathologic__
  * __responses to stress__
  * __Escape from injury__

# CELL INJURY AND CELL DEATH

# Cell injury

__Occurs;__

__So severe stress → unable to adapt__

__Exposed to inherently damaging agents\, intrinsic anomalies__

# Reversible cell injury

__Early\, mild forms__

__Reversible when damage is removed__

__No severe membrane damage__

__No nuclear dissolution__

# Cell death

* __Irreversible;__
* __Necrosis__
  * __Cell killed by external factor/cells__
* __Apoptosis__
  * __Cell kills itself__

|  | Necrosis | Apoptosis |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Cell size | Enlarged (swelling) | Reduced (shrinkage) |
| Nucleus | Pyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyolisis | Fragmantation into nucleosome size fragmants |
| Plasma membrane | Disrupted | Intact, orientation of lipids are altered |
| Cellular contents | Enzymatic digestion, may leak out of cell | Intact, may be released in apoptotic bodies |
| Adjacent inflammation | frequent | none |
|  | Pathologic, irreversible cell injury | Physiologic (eliminate unwanted cells)<br />Pathologic (DNA, protein damage) |

# Necrosis

* __Damage to membranes is severe:__
  * __enzymes leak out of lysosomes__
  * __enter the cytoplasm\,__
  * __digest the cell__
  * __necrosis\.__
* __Cellular contents leak into the extracellular space__
* __host reaction \(inflammation\)__

* __always a pathologic process__
* __reasons:__
  * __ischemia\,__
  * __exposure to toxins__
  * __various infections__
  * __trauma__

# Apoptosis

__nuclear dissolution__

__without complete loss of membrane integrity\. __

__Reasons:__

__deprivation of growth factors__

__DNA or proteins are damaged beyond repair__

__many normal functions and is not necessarily associated with pathologic cell injury__

__no inflammatory response__
