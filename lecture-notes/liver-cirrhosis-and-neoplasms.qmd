# Cirrhosis

* __Diffuse process characterized by fibrosis and the conversion of normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal nodules__
* __Not focal but rather involve most \(if not all\) of the diseased liver__
* __Fibrous septa__
  * __delicate bands or broad scars around multiple adjacent lobules__
  * __Long\-standing fibrosis generally is irreversible so long as disease persists or if disease\-associated vascular shunts are widespread__
  * __regression is possible if the underlying cause of liver disease is reversed__
* __Parenchymal nodules__
  * __<3 mm micronodules__
  * __>1 cm macronodules__
  * __encircled by fibrous bands__

* __Hepatocytes in these nodules derive from:__
* __Preexistent\, long\-lived hepatocytes that\, by the time cirrhosis is established\, display features of replicative senescence__
* __Newly formed hepatocytes capable of replication that are derived from stem/progenitor cells found adjacent to the canals of Hering and small bile ductules—the hepatobiliary stem cell niche__
  * __also give rise to the ductular reactions found at the periphery of most cirrhotic nodules\, where parenchyma meets stromal scar\, and are accompanied by proliferating endothelial cells\, myofibroblasts\, and inflammatory cells__

__Death of hepatocytes__

__Extracellular matrix deposition__

__Vascular reorganization__

__Damaged hepatocytes or by stimulated Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells__

__Produce__

__Reactive oxygen species\, growth factors\, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \(TNF\)\, interleukin\-1 \(IL\-1\)\, and lymphotoxins__

__Activate__

__Perisinusoidal stellate cells__

__Produce__

__Growth factors\, cytokines\, and chemokines\, transforming growth factor\-β \(TGF\-β\)__

__Their further proliferation and collagen synthesis__

__Portal fibroblasts also participate__

__Even in late\-stage disease\, if the disease process is halted or eliminated\, significant remodeling and even restoration of liver function \(cirrhotic regression\) is possible__

* __Vascular injuries and changes__
* __Inflammation and thrombosis of portal veins\, hepatic arteries\, and/or central veins__
* __Alternating zones of parenchymal hypoperfusion__
* __Parenchymal atrophy\, and hyperperfusion\, with overcompensating regeneration__
* __Loss of sinusoidal endothelial cell fenestrations__
* __Portal vein–hepatic vein and hepatic artery–portal vein vascular shunts__
* __Fast\-flowing vascular channels without solute exchange__
* __Loss of microvilli from the hepatocyte surface__
  * __diminishing its transport capacity__

  * __congenital bile duct hamartomas__
  * __usually isolated or present in small numbers__
  * __bile duct–like structures separated by bland\, densely collagenized stroma__
  * __No malignant potential__
  * __When multiple may indicate the presence of fibropolycystic disease of the liver\, association with polycystic kidney disease__

__Von Meyenburg complex__

__Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease__

# Focal Nodular Hyperplasia

* __Found in otherwise normal livers__
* __Localized\, well\-demarcated\, but poorly encapsulated lesion__
  * __Consisting of hyperplastic hepatocyte nodules__
  * __Central\, stellate fibrous scar__
* __Not a true neoplasm__
  * __Represents a response to abnormal vascular flow through a congenital or acquired vascular anomaly that gives rise to alternating areas of parenchymal regeneration and atrophy__
* __May range in size from 1 cm to many centimeters across__
* __Usually is an incidental finding__
* __Most commonly in women of reproductive age__
  * __may grow in response to estrogens__
* __No risk for malignancy__

# Hepatic Adenoma

__Benign hepatocellular neoplasm__

__Occurs in women of child\-bearing age__

__Oral contraceptive pills__

__Well\-demarcated but unencapsulated tumors__

__Pale\, yellow\-tan\, or bile\-stained and up to 30 cm in diameter__

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms16.png)

__Hepatic adenoma\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

* __Sheets and cords of cells__
* __Resemble normal hepatocytes__
  * __minimal variation in cell and nuclear size__
* __Portal tracts are absent__
* __Prominent arterial vessels and draining veins are distributed throughout__

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms17.png)

__B: Photomicrograph showing adenoma\, with cords of normal\-appearing hepatocytes\, absence of portal tracts\, and prominent neovascularization \(asterisks\)\. A large zone of infarcted tumor is present\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

* __Also called as Liver cell adenomas__
* __Intrahepatic mass\, mistaken for hepatocellular carcinoma__
* __Subcapsular adenomas are at risk for rupture__
  * __during pregnancy \(under estrogenic stimulation\)__
  * __life\-threatening intraabdominal hemorrhage__
* __With β\-catenin mutations carry a risk of developing into hepatocellular carcinoma__

# Hepatic Adenoma Types

* __Biallelic inactivation through somatic \(90%\) or germline \(10%\) mutations of either the HNF1A gene \(encoding a hepatocyte transcription factor\) or the CYP1B1 gene \(encoding cytochrome P\-450\)__
  * __35\-40%__
  * __Most common in women\, sometimes associated with oral contraceptive use\, and are often yellow from marked steatosis\. They carry little risk for malignant transformation__
* __Activating mutations of β\-catenin__
  * __10\-15%__
  * __High risk for malignant transformation__
  * __Most common in men__
  * __May be related to anabolic steroid use and possibly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease__

* __Inflammatory__
  * __50%__
  * __Associated with increased expression of acute phase reactant proteins__
    * __serum amyloid A and C\-reactive protein in the tumor and sometimes in the serum__
  * __10% of these tumors also have activating mutations of β\-catenin and may undergo malignant transformation__
  * __Most common in women__
  * __Associated with obesity and fatty liver disease__
  * __Identical to FNH\, and the distinction may be made by demonstrating an inflammatory phenotype \(such as by expression of serum amyloid A protein\, SAA\)__

# PRECURSOR LESIONS OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA

# Precursor Lesions of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

* __Cellular changes and nodular lesions__
  * __Chronic liver disease__
    * __Chronic viral hepatitis__
    * __Alcoholic liver disease__
    * __Metabolic diseases__
      * __AAT deficiency__
      * __Hereditary hemochromatosis__
* __Cellular Dysplasia__
  * __common in the setting of chronic viral hepatitis__
* __Usually they are found in late\-stage disease__
* __The processes that lead to cirrhosis and to malignant transformation usually take years to decades and run parallel to each other\, rather than in sequence__
* __Hepatocellular adenomas__

# Large cell change

__Scattered hepatocytes__

__Periportal or periseptal regions__

__Larger than normal hepatocytes__

__Pleomorphic\, often multiple nuclei__

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms18.png)

__A: Large cell change\. Very large hepatocytes with very large\, often atypical nuclei are scattered among normal\-size hepatocytes with round\, typical nuclei\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Small cell change

__Smaller than normal hepatocytes__

__Normal sized\, often hyperchromatic\, oval or angulated nuclei__

__May appear anywhere in the hepatic lobule__

__With formation of vaguely nodular clusters__

__Considered to be directly premalignant__

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms19.png)

__B: Small cell change \(SCC\)\. Normal\-appearing hepatocytes are in the lower right corner\. SCC is indicated by smaller than normal hepatocytes with thickened liver cell plates\, and high nuclear : cytoplasmic __

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Dysplastic Nodules

__Major pathway to hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic liver disease__

__Most cirrhotic nodules range 0\.3\-0\.8 cm__

__Dysplastic nodules often are 1\- 2 cm__

__High risk for malignant transformation__

__Sometimes contain overtly malignant subnodules__

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms20.png)

__A: Hepatitis C–related cirrhosis with a distinctively large nodule \(arrows\)\. Nodule\-in\-nodule growth in this dysplastic nodule suggests a high grade lesion\.__

__B: Histologically the region within the box in A shows a well\-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma \(HCC\) \(right side\) and a subnodule of moderately differentiated HCC within it \(center\, left\)\.__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMAS

# Hepatocellular Carcinomas

* __Infection with HBV or HCV\, alcoholic cirrhosis\, and aflatoxin exposure__
* __NAFLD\, hemochromatosis\, α 1 \-antitrypsin deficiency\, tyrosinemia__
* __Many variables\, including age\, gender\, chemicals\, viruses\, hormones\, alcohol\, and nutrition\, interact in the development of HCC__
* __The disease most likely to give rise is hereditary tyrosinemia__
* __Japan and Central Europe\, chronic HCV infection__
* __China and southern Africa\, HBV is endemic__
  * __high\-level exposure to dietary aflatoxins derived from the fungus Aspergillus flavus is also common__
  * __“moldy” grains and peanuts__
  * __Aflatoxin can bind covalently with cellular DNA\, resulting in mutations in genes such as TP53__

__Tumors may arise from both mature hepatocytes and progenitor cells \(known as ductular cells or oval cells\)__

__Grossly as__

__a unifocal\, usually massive tumor__

__a multifocal tumor made of nodules of variable size__

__a diffusely infiltrative cancer\, permeating widely and sometimes involving the entire liver\, blending imperceptibly into the cirrhotic background__

__Discrete tumor masses usually are yellow\-white\, punctuated sometimes by bile staining and areas of hemorrhage or necrosis__

__Strong propensity for vascular invasion__

__Extensive intrahepatic metastases are characteristic__

__Snakelike masses of tumor invade the portal vein \(with occlusion of the portal circulation\) or inferior vena cava\, extending even into the right side of the heart__

![](img%5CLiver-Cirrhosis-and-Neoplasms22.png)

__Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease__

__Range from well\-differentiated lesions that reproduce hepatocytes arranged in cords\, trabeculae or glandular patterns__

__To poorly differentiated lesions\, often composed of large\, multinucleate anaplastic giant cells__

__Globules of bile may be found within the cytoplasm of cells and in pseudocanaliculi between cells__

__Acidophilic hyaline inclusions within the cytoplasm may be present\, resembling Mallory bodies__

__There is little stroma in most hepatocellular carcinomas\, explaining their soft consistency__

# Fibrolamellar HCC

__Young male and female adults \(20\-40 years of age\)__

__No association with cirrhosis or other risk factors__

__Single tumor with fibrous bands coursing through it__

__Superficially resembling focal nodular hyperplasia__

__Fibrolamellar variant has a better prognosis than that of the other\, more common variants__
