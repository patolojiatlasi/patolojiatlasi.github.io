# Nomenclature and Classification of Neoplasia

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# What is Cancer?

* __“A neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue\, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli which evoked the change\.”__
  * __British oncologist R\.Willis\, 1952__

# Cancer is a genetic disease

__Genetic changes allow excessive and unregulated proliferation that becomes autonomous \(independent of physiologic growth stimuli\)\, although tumors generally remain dependent on the host for their nutrition and blood supply\.__

# The field of Cancer Research is broad

* __Pathology__
* __Morphology__
* __Pharmacology__
* __Genetics__
* __Epidemiology__
* __Biochemistry__
* __System Biology__
* __Evolution__
* __Population dynamics__
* __…__
* __AS WELL AS__
  * __Quackery\, fraudulency\, charlatan\, cheating …\.__

# When will there be a cure for cancer?

__Which cancer?__

__Hodgkin lymphoma is highly curable__

__Pancreas Cancer is nearly always fatal__

# Cancer is a genetic disorder

* __DNA mutations__
  * __acquired spontaneously__
  * __induced by environmental insults__
* __Epigenetic changes__
  * __DNA methylation__
  * __Histone modifications__
* __Genetic instability__
* __Genetic changes affect the ability of__
  * __Growth\, survival\, senescence__

# Genetic alterations are heritable

__Passed to daughter cells via cell division__

__Cells with growth and survival advantages dominate the population__

__One single cell ultimately gives rise to the tumor → all tumors are clonal__

# Hallmarks of Cancer - Properties of Cancer

* __self\-sufficiency in growth signals__
  * __whereby the growth of cancers becomes autonomous and is unregulated by physiologic cues__
* __lack of response to growth inhibitory signals that control non\-neoplastic cellular proliferations such as hyperplasias__
* __evasion of cell death\, allowing cancer cells to survive under conditions that induce apoptosis in normal cells__
* __limitless replicative potential\, thus making cancer cells immortal__
  * __He\-La __  __Cell__  __ Line__
* __development of angiogenesis to sustain the growth of cancer cells__
* __ability to invade local tissues and spread to distant sites__
* __reprogramming of metabolic pathways—specifically\, a switch to aerobic glycolysis even when there is abundant oxygen__
* __ability to evade the immune system__

# NOMENCLATURE

# Some Terminology

__Aplasia__

__Hyperplasia__

__Metaplasia__

__Neoplasia__

__Dysplasia__

__Tumor__

__Mass__

__Oncology \(oncos: tumor\)__

# Neoplasia “new growth”

* __Neoplastic__
  * __Transformed__
* __Continue to replicate__
  * __does not take into account the control of normal regulatory influences of growth__
  * __Autonomy__
    * __Not complete some still require endocrine stimulation\, treated as such__
* __Increase in size__
  * __Depend on the host for nutrition\, blood supply__

# Benign Tumors

__Microscopic and gross characteristics are considered to be relatively innocent__

__remain localized\, local surgical removal__

__patient generally survives__

__sometimes they are responsible for serious disease__

# Malignant Tumors

__Cancers__

__From the Latin word for “crab”__

__Adhere to any part that they seize in an obstinate manner\, similar to a crab’s behavior__

# 

__Cancer__

__Carcinoma__

__Malignant Epithelial Tumor__

__Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor__

__Small Blue Round Cell Tumor__

__Leukeima__

__Lymphoma__

# Malignant

__Invade and destroy adjacent structures__

__Spread to distant sites \(metastasize\) __

__Cause death__

__Not all cancers go into a deadly course__

__Most aggressive are also some of the most curable__

# Tumors have two components

* __Parenchyma__
  * __Transformed or neoplastic cells__
* __Stroma__
  * __Supporting\, host\-derived\, non\-neoplastic stroma__
  * __Connective tissue\, blood vessels\, and host\-derived inflammatory cells__

* __Parenchyma__
  * __determines its biologic behavior__
  * __tumors named according to parenchmal cells__
* __Stroma__
  * __crucial to the growth of the neoplasm__
  * __blood supply__
  * __support for the growth__
* __A two\-way conversation__
  * __Epithelial Mesenchymal Interactions / Transitions__

# Nomenclature of Neoplasms

* __A problem of Taxonomy__
* __Classification of Neoplasms__
* __Subject to change over time__
* __Different classification schemes and proposals for each group of tumor__
  * __Schools are different:__
    * __Japanese\, European\, North American\, South American__
  * __Authors from same country also have different opinions__

# WHO Classification of Neoplasms

* __Updated every 5\-7 years__
* __Aim is:__
  * __To form a unified terminology__
  * __Define distinct diseases in terms of morphological\, clinical\, genetic features__
  * __Started adding therapeutic subgroups as well__
