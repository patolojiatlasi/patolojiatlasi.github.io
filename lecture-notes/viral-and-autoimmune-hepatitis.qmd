__The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma__

__0\.02% per year for chronic hepatitis B__

__2\.5% per year when cirrhosis has developed__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Hepatitis B

__HBV replication does not involve the integration of the virus in the DNA of the host cell__

__Integrated HBV frequently is found in cells__

__The integrated viruses generally have large deletions and rearrangements and usually become inactive__

* __HBcAg__
  * __The precore/core region of a nucleocapsid “core” protein\, the hepatitis B core antigen__
  * __retained in the infected hepatocyte__
* __HBeAg__
  * __a precore protein__
  * __secreted into blood and is essential for the establishment of persistent infection__
* __HBsAg__
  * __Envelope glycoprotein__
  * __surface antigen__
  * __produced and secreted into the blood in massive amounts__
  * __Blood HBsAg is immunogenic__

* __A DNA polymerase__
  * __error\-prone reverse transcriptase activity__
  * __generates mutations in the genomes of replicating virus at a high rate__
* __HBV\-X protein__
  * __transcriptional transactivator for many viral and host genes__
  * __required for viral infectivity__
  * __may have a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating p53 degradation and expression__

__Innate immunity protects the host during the initial phases of the infection__

__A strong response by virus\-specific CD4\+ and CD8\+ interferon γ–producing cells is associated with the resolution of acute infection__

__HBV does not cause direct hepatocyte injury__

__Hepatocyte damage results from killing of the virus\-infected cells by CD8\+ cytotoxic T cells__

__Chronic HBV infection__

__Some hepatocytes may have viral genomes integrated into the host genome__

__If surface antigen gene integrates cell produces it__

__Usually in such cells full viral replication does not take place__

__The antigen just accumulates in these cells__

__Large cytoplasmic inclusion consisting of endoplasmic reticulum stuffed with surface antigen __

__Fine\, smoothly granular appearance similar to that of ground glass__

# Hepatitis C

__Subclassified into six genotypes\, based on the genetic sequence__

__Infected person may carry many HCV variants__

![](img%5CViral-and-Autoimmune-Hepatitis17.png)

__The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is 1% to 4% per year__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Anti\-HCV antibodies develop within weeks to a few months\, they do not confer effective immunity__

__Strong immune responses involving CD4\+ and CD8\+ cells are associated with self\-limited HCV infections__

__It is not known why only a minority of persons are capable of clearing HCV infection__

__Persistent infection is the hallmark of HCV infection\, occurring in 80% to 85% of patients with subclinical or asymptomatic acute infection__

* __Typical features of chronic hepatitis__
* __Fatty change__
  * __Altered lipid metabolism in infected hepatocytes__
  * __Insulin resistance__
* __Lymphoid infiltrates in portal tracts\, sometimes with fully formed lymphoid follicles__
* __Bile duct injury__
  * __Direct infection of cholangiocytes by the virus__

__In HBV and HCV infection\, circulating antibody\-antigen complexes produce immune\-complex disease in the form of vasculitis \(subcutaneous or visceral\) and glomerulonephritis__

__Cryoglobulinemia is found in 50% of patients with hepatitis C__

# Hepatitis D Virus

* __Delta hepatitis virus__
* __Arises in two settings__
* __Acute coinfection after exposure to serum containing both HDV and HBV__
  * __Most coinfected persons clear the viruses and recover completely__
* __Superinfection of a chronic carrier of HBV with a new inoculum of HDV__
  * __Most superinfected persons there is an acceleration of hepatitis\, progressing to more severe chronic hepatitis 4 to 7 weeks later__
