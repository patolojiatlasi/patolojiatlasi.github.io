# Diseases and Tumors of Exocrine Pancreas

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# DISEASES OF EXOCRINE PANCREAS

# Pancreas

* __Exocrine organ__
  * __Acinar cells__
    * __Produce the digestive enzymes__
  * __Ductules and ducts__
    * __Cuboidal cells lining the smaller ductules secrete bicarbonate\-rich fluid__
    * __Columnar cells lining the larger ducts produce mucin__
    * __Larger ducts also express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator \(CFTR\)__
      * __aberrant function of this membrane protein affects the viscosity of the pancreatic secretions__
* __Endocrine organ__
  * __ islets of Langerhans__
  * __secrete insulin\, glucagon\, and somatostatin__

# Inhibitors of autodigestion of the pancreas

__Pancreatic enzymes are synthesized as inactive proenzymes__

__Sequestered in membrane\-bound zymogen granules__

__Activation of proenzymes requires conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin by duodenal enteropeptidase \(enterokinase\)__

__Trypsin inhibitors \(e\.g\.\, SPINK1\, also known as pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor\) are secreted by acinar and ductal cells__

__Trypsin cleaves and inactivates itself__

__Acinar cells are remarkably resistant to the action of activated enzymes__

# Cystic Fibrosis

![](img%5CDiseases-and-Tumors-of-Exocrine-Pancreas1.png)

__Cystic fibrosis__

__The acinar tissue of the pancreas has been replaced by adipose tissue\.__

__Pancreas in cystic fibrosis\. The ducts are dilated and plugged with eosinophilic mucin\, and the parenchymal glands are atrophic and replaced by fibrous tissue\.__

__Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease__

# CONGENITAL ANOMALIES

# Agenesis

__Very rarely__

__Totally absent__

__Usually associated with additional severe malformations that are incompatible with life__

# Pancreas Divisum

__Most common clinically significant congenital pancreatic anomaly__

__Incidence of 3\-10% in autopsy series__

__Duct systems of the fetal pancreatic primordia fail to fuse__

__bulk of the pancreas \(from the dorsal pancreatic primordium\) drains through the minor sphincter\, which has a narrow opening__

__elevated intraductal pressures throughout most of the pancreas__

__increased risk for chronic pancreatitis__

# Congenital Cysts

__anomalous development of the pancreatic ducts__

__may be with polycystic diseases__

__generally unilocular and range from microscopic to 5 cm in diameter__

__lined by either uniform cuboidal or flattened epithelium__

__enclosed in a thin\, fibrous capsule__

__contain clear serous fluid__

__Pancreatic cysts__

__Thin\-walled\, serous\, fluid\-filled cysts may be found in the pancreas in some patients with autosomal\-dominant polycystic kidney disease\.__

# PANCREATITIS

# Acute Pancreatitis

* __Peritoneum contains a serous\, slightly turbid\, brown\-tinged fluid with globules of fat \(derived from enzymatically digested adipose tissue\)__
* __Most severe form → hemorrhagic pancreatitis__
