# Pulmonary Circulation Disorders

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# PTE, HEMORRHAGE, INFARCTION

# Pulmonary Embolism

- **Blood clots occlude the large pulmonary arteries almost always
  embolic**
- **\>95% of all pulmonary emboli arise from large deep veins of the
  lower legs**
  - **popliteal vein and larger veins above it**
- **Can be small and clinically silent**
- **Among hospitalized patients autopsy data 1-30%**
  - **Severe burns, trauma, or fractures**

# Venous thrombosis predisposing factors

- **Prolonged bedrest**
  - **With immobilization of the legs**
- **Surgery**
  - **Orthopedic surgery, of knee and hip**
- **Severe trauma**
  - **Burns, multiple fractures**
- **Congestive heart failure**
- **In women, the period around parturition or oral contraception using
  birth control pills with high estrogen content**
- **Disseminated cancer**
- **Primary disorders of hypercoagulability**
  - **Factor V Leiden**

# Two important consequences of PTE

- **Increase in pulmonary artery pressure**
  - **From blockage of flow**
  - **Vasospasm caused by neurogenic mechanisms**
  - **Release of mediators**
    - **Thromboxane A2, serotonin**
- **ischemia of the downstream pulmonary parenchyma**

# Pulmonary Thromboembolism

- **Sudden increase in pulmonary artery pressure**
- **Diminished cardiac output**
- **Right-sided heart failure**
  - **Acute cor pulmonale**
- **Death**

# Hypoxemia develops in PTE

- **Perfusion of lung zones that have become atelectatic**
  - **Alveolar collapse occurs in the ischemic areas**
  - **Reduction in surfactant production**
  - **Pain leads to reduced movement of the chest wall**
  - **Pulmonary blood flow is redirected through areas of the lung that
    normally are hypoventilated**
- **Decrease in cardiac output**
  - **Widening of the difference in arterial-venous oxygen saturation**
- **Right-to-left shunting of blood**
  - **Patent foramen ovale, present in 30% of normal persons**

# Ischemic necrosis in PTE

- **Ischemic necrosis (infarction) occur in 10% in PTE**
  - **compromise in cardiac function or bronchial circulation**
  - **that area is underventilated as a result of underlying pulmonary
    disease**

# PTE

**60-80% of emboli are clinically silent**

**5% cause acute cor pulmonale, shock, or death**

**Pulmonary infarction**

- **Emboli usually resolve after the initial acute event**
  - **Contract**
  - **Endogenous fibrinolytic activity**
  - **Total lysis of the thrombus**
- **Risk of recurrence is high**
  - **30% chance of developing a second**

# Infarction

- **Compromised cardiovascular status**
  - **Congestive heart failure**
- **The more peripheral the embolic occlusion, the higher the risk of
  infarction**
- **3/4 lower lobes**
- **\>1/2 are multiple**
- **Wedge-shaped**
  - **Base at the pleural surface and the apex pointing toward the
    hilus**

**A small, roughly wedge-shaped hemorrhagic pulmonary infarct of recent
occurrence**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

# Hemorrhagic infarcts

**Lungs have dual circulation**

**Raised, red-blue areas in the early stages**

**Adjacent pleural surface covered by a fibrinous exudate**

**Occluded vessel is found near the apex of the infarcted area**

- **Red cells begin to lyse within 48 hours**
- **Infarct pales**
- **Red-brown**
  - **Hemosiderin**
- **Fibrous replacement begins at the margins**
  - **Gray-white peripheral zone**
  - **Converts the infarct into a scar**
- **Hallmark of fresh infarcts is coagulative necrosis of the lung
  parenchyma and hemorrhage**

# Nonthrombotic forms of pulmonary embolism

- **Air, fat, and amniotic fluid embolism**
- **Bone marrow embolism**
  - **Massive trauma**
  - **Bone infarction secondary to sickle cell anemia**
- **Foreign body embolism**
  - **Intravenous drug abuse**
- **Magnesium trisilicate (talc) → granulomatous response**

# Talc Granulomas

**Talc in interstitium → fibrosis**

**Talc in pulmonary arteries → Pulmonary hypertension**

**Talc crystals can be demonstrated by polarized light**

# PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

# Pulmonary Hypertension

**Mean pulmonary pressures reach one fourth or more of systemic levels**

**Most often secondary to a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the
pulmonary vascular bed**

**Increased pulmonary vascular blood flow**

# Secondary pulmonary hypertension

- **Chronic obstructive or interstitial lung disease**
  - **Destruction of lung parenchyma**
  - **Consequent reduction in alveolar capillaries**
  - **Increased pulmonary arterial resistance**
  - **Elevated arterial pressure**
- **Recurrent pulmonary emboli**
  - **Reduction in the functional cross-sectional area**
  - **Increased vascular resistance**
- **Antecedent heart disease**
  - **Mitral stenosis**
  - **Increases left atrial pressure**
  - **Higher pulmonary venous pressures**
  - **Pulmonary arterial hypertension**
- **Congenital left-to-right shunts**

# Primary, idiopathic, pulmonary arterial hypertension

**Most cases are sporadic**

**6% are familial with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance**

# Secondary pulmonary hypertension

- **Endothelial cell dysfunction**
  - **Due to the underlying disorder**
  - **Mechanical injury due to increased blood flow in left-to-right
    shunts**
  - **Biochemical injury produced by fibrin in recurrent
    thromboembolism**
- **Reduced production of vasodilatory agents**
  - **Nitric oxide, prostacyclin**
- **Increasing synthesis of vasoconstrictive mediators**
  - **Endothelin**
- **Production of growth factors and cytokines**
  - **Induce the migration and replication of vascular smooth muscle**
  - **Elaboration of extracellular matrix**

# Primary pulmonary hypertension

- **Uncommon familial form**
- **TGF-β signaling pathway**
  - **Key mediator of endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction**
  - **Germline mutations of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2
    (BMPR-2)**
- **The BMPR2 gene product**
  - **a cell surface molecule that binds to a variety of TGF-β pathway
    ligands**
  - **inhibits proliferation**
  - **When mutated → abnormal vascular endothelial and pulmonary smooth
    muscle proliferation**
- **Possible role for the serotonin transporter gene (5HTT)**
  - **Pulmonary smooth muscle cells increased proliferation on exposure
    to serotonin**

# Vascular alterations in all forms of pulmonary hypertension

- **Involve the entire arterial tree**
- **In the main elastic arteries**
  - **Atheromas**
- **In medium-sized muscular arteries**
  - **Proliferation of myointimal cells and smooth muscle cells**
  - **Cause thickening of the intima and media**
  - **Narrowing of the lumina**
- **In smaller arteries and arterioles**
  - **Thickening, medial hypertrophy, and reduplication of the internal
    and external elastic membranes**
- **The wall thickness may exceed the diameter of the lumen**
  - **Point of near-obliteration**
