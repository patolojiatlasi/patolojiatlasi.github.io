**Injured axons undergo swelling and show disruption of axonal
transport**

**Swellings (spheroids) can be recognized on H&E stains and can be
highlighted by silver staining or immunohistochemistry.**

![](img%5CTraumatic-Diseases-of-CNS1.png)

**Axonal spheroids are visible as bulbous swellings at points of
disruption, or altered axonal transport.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Axonal injury**

**-leads to cell body enlargement and rounding**

**-peripheral displacement of the nucleus**

**-enlargement of the nucleolus**

**-peripheral dispersion of Nissl substance (central chromatolysis)**

**C: With axonal injury there can be swelling of the cell body and
peripheral dispersal of the Nissl substance, termed chromatolysis.**

# Traumatic Diseases of CNS

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Central Nervous System Trauma

- **Significant cause of death and disability**
- **Severity and site of injury affect the outcome**
  - **injury of several cubic centimeters of brain parenchyma**
    - **frontal lobe → clinically silent**
    - **spinal cord → severely disabling**
    - **brain stem → fatal**

**Penetrating trauma**

**Blunt trauma**

**Open injury**

**Closed injury**

- **The magnitude and distribution of lesions depend on**

  - **shape of the object causing the trauma**
  - **force of impact**
  - **whether the head is in motion at the time of injury**

- **External signs may not correlate with severity of brain injury**

- **Injuries may involve the parenchyma, the vasculature, or both**

- **Repetitive episodes of trauma can lead to later development of
  neurodegenerative processes**

  - **Muhammed Ali**

- **Association of trauma with the risk of Alzheimer disease**

- **Trauma-associated degeneration**

  - **chronic traumatic encephalopathy**
  - **intraneuronal tau protein inclusions**

# Traumatic Parenchymal Injuries

- **When an object impacts the head**
- **Coup injury**
  - **Injury occur at the site of impact **
- **Contrecoup injury**
  - **opposite the site of impact on the other side of the brain**
- **Both coup and contrecoup lesions are contusions**
  - **rapid tissue displacement**
  - **disruption of vascular channels**
  - **subsequent hemorrhage**
  - **tissue injury**
  - **edema**
- **Crests of the gyri are the part of the brain that is most
  susceptible to traumatic injury**
- **Contusions are common in regions of the brain overlying rough and
  irregular inner skull surfaces**
  - **orbitofrontal regions and the temporal lobe tips**
- **Penetration of the brain**
  - **bullet**
  - **skull fragment from a fracture**
  - **laceration, with tissue tearing, vascular disruption, and
    hemorrhage**

**Contusions, wedge-shaped, widest aspect closest to the point of
impact**

**Acute contusions are present in both temporal lobes, with areas of
hemorrhage and tissue disruption**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**In contrast with ischemic lesions, in which the superficial layer of
cortex may be preserved, trauma affects the superficial layers most
severely**

![](img%5CTraumatic-Diseases-of-CNS6.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Few hours of injury**
  - **blood extravasates throughout the involved tissue**
  - **across the width of the cerebral cortex**
  - **into the white matter**
  - **subarachnoid spaces**
- **Functional effects are seen earlier**
- **Morphologic evidence of injury takes about 24 hours to appear**
  - **nuclear pyknosis, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, cellular
    disintegration**
- **Inflammatory response to the injured tissue follows its usual
  course, with neutrophils preceding the appearance of macrophages**

![](img%5CTraumatic-Diseases-of-CNS7.png)

**Old traumatic lesions have a characteristic macroscopic appearance**

**-depressed, retracted, yellowish brown patches involving the crests of
gyri **

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

**Remote orbital surface contusions**

# Diffuse axonal injury

**Trauma can also cause more subtle but widespread injury to axons
within the brain**

**Movement of one region of brain relative to another is thought to
disrupt axonal integrity and function**

**Angular acceleration, even in the absence of impact, may cause axonal
injury as well as hemorrhage**

**50% of patients who develop coma shortly after trauma are believed to
have white matter damage and diffuse axonal injury**

# Concussion

**reversible altered consciousness from head injury in the absence of
contusion**

**loss of consciousness, temporary respiratory arrest, and loss of
reflexes**

**neurologic recovery is complete, amnesia for the event persists**

**The pathogenesis of the sudden disruption of nervous activity is
unknown**

# Traumatic Vascular Injury

- **CNS trauma directly disrupts vessel walls**
  - **epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, or intraparenchymal**
  - **occur alone or in combination**
  - **Subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages most often occur at
    sites of contusions and lacerations**

# Epidural Hematoma

- **Dural vessels are vulnerable to traumatic injury**
  - **Middle meningeal artery**
- **Infants**
  - **traumatic displacement of the easily deformable skull may tear a
    vessel, even in the absence of a skull fracture**
- **children and adults**
  - **tears almost always stem from skull fractures**
- **Blood accumulates under arterial pressure **
- **Dissect the tightly applied dura away from the inner skull surface**
- **Produce a hematoma that compresses the brain surface**

**Epidural hematoma covering a portion of the dura**

# Subdural Hematoma

- **Rapid movement of the brain during trauma**
- **Tear the bridging veins that extend from the cerebral hemispheres
  through the subarachnoid and subdural space to the dural sinuses**
- **Bleeding into the subdural space**
- **Elderly**
  - **Patients with brain atrophy, the bridging veins are stretched out,
    and the brain has additional space within which to move, accounting
    for the higher rate of subdural hematomas**
- **Infants also are susceptible**
  - **bridging veins are thin-walled**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Manifest within the first 48 hours after injury**

**Most common over the lateral aspects of the cerebral hemispheres and
may be bilateral**

# Acute subdural hematoma

**Collection of freshly clotted blood apposed to the contour of the
brain surface**

**Without extension into the depths of sulci**

**Underlying brain is flattened**

**Subarachnoid space is often clear**

**Venous bleeding is self-limited**

**Breakdown and organization of the hematoma take place over time**

**Evolving subdural hematoma. The semiliquid membrane-bound mass of
blood in the subdural space **

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

![](img%5CTraumatic-Diseases-of-CNS14.png)

**Subdural hematomas organize**

**1 week → lysis of the clot**

**2 weeks → growth of granulation tissue from the dural surface into the
hematoma**

**1 to 3 months → fibrosis**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

![](img%5CTraumatic-Diseases-of-CNS15.png)

**Large organizing subdural hematoma attached to the dura**

**Organized hematomas are attached to the dura, but not to the
underlying arachnoid**

**subdural membranes**

**Fibrosing lesions may retract, leave a thin layer of connective
tissue**

**Subdural hematomas commonly rebleed**

**chronic subdural hematomas**

**From the thin-walled vessels of the granulation tissue, leading to
microscopic findings consistent with hemorrhages of varying age**
