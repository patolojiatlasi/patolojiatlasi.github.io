# Pathology of the Stomach

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Stomach

- **Cardia**
  - **Lined mainly by mucin-secreting foveolar cells that form small
    glands**
- **Antrum**
  - **Similar to cardia**
  - **Contain endocrine cells**
  - **G cells release gastrin to stimulate luminal acid secretion by
    parietal cells within the gastric fundus and body**
- **Body, funds**
  - **Glands contain chief cells**
  - **Produce and secrete digestive enzymes, pepsin**

# Acute Gastritis

**Transient mucosal inflammatory process**

**May be asymptomatic**

**Cause variable degrees of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting**

**In severe cases mucosal erosion, ulceration, hemorrhage, hematemesis,
melena, massive blood loss**

# Protective mechanisms of gastric epithelium

- **Gastric lumen is strongly acidic, pH ~1**
  - **potential to damage the mucosa**
- **Mechanisms protect the gastric mucosa**
  - **Mucin secreted by surface foveolar cells**
  - **A thin layer of mucus**
    - **prevents large food particles from directly touching the
      epithelium**
  - **Neutral pH as a result of bicarbonate ion secretion by surface
    epithelial cells**
  - **Rich vascular supply to the gastric mucosa**
    - **oxygen, bicarbonate, and nutrients**
    - **washing away acid that has back-diffused into the lamina
      propria**

![](img%5CPathology-of-the-Stomach6.png)

# Disruption of protective mechanisms result in gastritis

- **Reduced mucin synthesis in elderly**
- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**

**Decreased acid, decreased intrinsic factor**

**Increased gastrin production by Neuroendocrine cells**

**Hypergastrinemia and hyperplasia of antral gastrin-producing G cells**

**No intrinsic factor, no ileal vitamin B 12 absorption, B12 deficiency,
megaloblastic anemia (pernicious anemia)**

**Reduced serum concentration of pepsinogen reflects chief cell loss**

- **Diffuse damage of the oxyntic mucosa within the body and fundus**
- **Damage to the antrum and cardia typically is absent or mild**
- **Diffuse atrophy**
  - **the oxyntic mucosa of the body and fundus appears markedly
    thinned, and rugal folds are lost**
- **Inflammatory infiltrate more commonly is composed of lymphocytes,
  macrophages, and plasma cells**
  - **Inflammatory reaction most often is deep and centered on the
    gastric glands**
- **Intestinal metaplasia may develop**
