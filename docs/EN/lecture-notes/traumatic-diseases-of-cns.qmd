__Injured axons undergo swelling and show disruption of axonal transport__

__Swellings \(spheroids\) can be recognized on H&E stains and can be highlighted by silver staining or immunohistochemistry\.__

__Axonal spheroids are visible as bulbous swellings at points of disruption\, or altered axonal transport\.__

__Axonal injury__

__\-leads to cell body enlargement and rounding__

__\-peripheral displacement of the nucleus__

__\-enlargement of the nucleolus__

__\-peripheral dispersion of Nissl substance \(central chromatolysis\)__

# Traumatic Diseases of CNS

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Central Nervous System Trauma

* __Significant cause of death and disability__
* __Severity and site of injury affect the outcome__
  * __injury of several cubic centimeters of brain parenchyma__
    * __frontal lobe → clinically silent__
    * __spinal cord → severely disabling__
    * __brain stem → fatal__

__Penetrating trauma__

__Blunt trauma__

__Open injury__

__Closed injury__

* __The magnitude and distribution of lesions depend on__
  * __shape of the object causing the trauma__
  * __force of impact__
  * __whether the head is in motion at the time of injury__
* __External signs may not correlate with severity of brain injury__
* __Injuries may involve the parenchyma\, the vasculature\, or both__

* __Repetitive episodes of trauma can lead to later development of neurodegenerative processes__
  * __Muhammed Ali__
* __Association of trauma with the risk of Alzheimer disease__
* __Trauma\-associated degeneration__
  * __chronic traumatic encephalopathy__
  * __intraneuronal tau protein inclusions__

# Traumatic Parenchymal Injuries

* __When an object impacts the head__
* __Coup injury__
  * __Injury occur at the site of impact __
* __Contrecoup injury__
  * __opposite the site of impact on the other side of the brain__
* __Both coup and contrecoup lesions are contusions__
  * __rapid tissue displacement__
  * __disruption of vascular channels__
  * __subsequent hemorrhage__
  * __tissue injury__
  * __edema__

* __Crests of the gyri are the part of the brain that is most susceptible to traumatic injury__
* __Contusions are common in regions of the brain overlying rough and irregular inner skull surfaces__
  * __orbitofrontal regions and the temporal lobe tips__

* __Penetration of the brain__
  * __bullet__
  * __skull fragment from a fracture__
  * __laceration\, with tissue tearing\, vascular disruption\, and hemorrhage__

__Contusions\, wedge\-shaped\, widest aspect closest to the point of impact__

__Acute contusions are present in both temporal lobes\, with areas of hemorrhage and tissue disruption__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__In contrast with ischemic lesions\, in which the superficial layer of cortex may be preserved\, trauma affects the superficial layers most severely__

![](./img-local/Traumatic-Diseases-of-CNS6.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

* __Few hours of injury__
  * __blood extravasates throughout the involved tissue__
  * __across the width of the cerebral cortex__
  * __into the white matter__
  * __subarachnoid spaces__
* __Functional effects are seen earlier__
* __Morphologic evidence of injury takes about 24 hours to appear__
  * __nuclear pyknosis\, cytoplasmic eosinophilia\, cellular disintegration__
* __Inflammatory response to the injured tissue follows its usual course\, with neutrophils preceding the appearance of macrophages__

__Old traumatic lesions have a characteristic macroscopic appearance__

__\-depressed\, retracted\, yellowish brown patches involving the crests of gyri __

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

__Remote orbital surface contusions__

# Diffuse axonal injury

__Trauma can also cause more subtle but widespread injury to axons within the brain__

__Movement of one region of brain relative to another is thought to disrupt axonal integrity and function__

__Angular acceleration\, even in the absence of impact\, may cause axonal injury as well as hemorrhage__

__50% of patients who develop coma shortly after trauma are believed to have white matter damage and diffuse axonal injury__

# Concussion

__reversible altered consciousness from head injury in the absence of contusion__

__loss of consciousness\, temporary respiratory arrest\, and loss of reflexes__

__neurologic recovery is complete\, amnesia for the event persists__

__The pathogenesis of the sudden disruption of nervous activity is unknown__

# Traumatic Vascular Injury

* __CNS trauma directly disrupts vessel walls__
  * __epidural\, subdural\, subarachnoid\, or intraparenchymal__
  * __occur alone or in combination__
  * __Subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages most often occur at sites of contusions and lacerations__

# Epidural Hematoma

* __Dural vessels are vulnerable to traumatic injury__
  * __Middle meningeal artery__
* __Infants__
  * __traumatic displacement of the easily deformable skull may tear a vessel\, even in the absence of a skull fracture__
* __children and adults__
  * __tears almost always stem from skull fractures__
* __Blood accumulates under arterial pressure __
* __Dissect the tightly applied dura away from the inner skull surface__
* __Produce a hematoma that compresses the brain surface__

__Epidural hematoma covering a portion of the dura__

# Subdural Hematoma

* __Rapid movement of the brain during trauma__
* __Tear the bridging veins that extend from the cerebral hemispheres through the subarachnoid and subdural space to the dural sinuses__
* __Bleeding into the subdural space__
* __Elderly__
  * __Patients with brain atrophy\, the bridging veins are stretched out\, and the brain has additional space within which to move\, accounting for the higher rate of subdural hematomas__
* __Infants also are susceptible__
  * __bridging veins are thin\-walled__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Manifest within the first 48 hours after injury__

__Most common over the lateral aspects of the cerebral hemispheres and may be bilateral__

# Acute subdural hematoma

__Collection of freshly clotted blood apposed to the contour of the brain surface__

__Without extension into the depths of sulci__

__Underlying brain is flattened__

__Subarachnoid space is often clear__

__Venous bleeding is self\-limited__

__Breakdown and organization of the hematoma take place over time__

__Evolving subdural hematoma\. The semiliquid membrane\-bound mass of blood in the subdural space __

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

![](./img-local/Traumatic-Diseases-of-CNS14.png)

__Subdural hematomas organize__

__1 week → lysis of the clot__

__2 weeks → growth of granulation tissue from the dural surface into the hematoma__

__1 to 3 months → fibrosis__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

![](./img-local/Traumatic-Diseases-of-CNS15.png)

__Large organizing subdural hematoma attached to the dura__

__Organized hematomas are attached to the dura\, but not to the underlying arachnoid__

__subdural membranes__

__Fibrosing lesions may retract\, leave a thin layer of connective tissue__

__Subdural hematomas commonly rebleed__

__chronic subdural hematomas__

__From the thin\-walled vessels of the granulation tissue\, leading to microscopic findings consistent with hemorrhages of varying age__
