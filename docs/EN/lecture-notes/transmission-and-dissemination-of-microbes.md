# Transmission and Dissemination of Microbes

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# How microbes enter body?

**Microbes enter the body if they overcome the natural barriers and
defense mechanisms**

# Natural barriers

**Intact Skin**

**Mucosa**

**Blood Brain Barrier**

**Natural barriers are physical barriers and produce antimicrobial
substances**

# Defense mechanisms

**Saliva**

**Tear**

**sIgA**

**Peyer’s patches**

# Routes of Entry of Microbes

**Breaches in the skin**

**Inhalation**

**Ingestion**

**Sexual transmission**

# Infections occur in otherwise healthy persons

- **Respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract infections**
  - **Virulent microorgansims**
  - **Capable of damaging or penetrating intact epithelial barriers**
- **Skin infections**
  - **Damaged sites (cuts and burns)**
- **Genitourinary infections**
  - **HPV, damaged cervical epithelium**

# SKIN

![](img%5CTransmission-and-Dissemination-of-Microbes1.png)

# Skin

- **Dense, keratinized outer layer**
- **A natural barrier to infection**
- **Low pH of the skin (\<5.5), presence of fatty acids**
  - **inhibit growth of microorganisms other than the normal flora**
- **Normal flora**
  - **including potential opportunists**
  - **S. aureus and C. albicans**

# Microorganisms penetrate through breaks in the skin

**Superficial pricks → fungal infections**

**Wounds → staphylococci**

**Burns → Pseudomonas aeruginosa**

**Diabetic and pressure-related foot sores → multibacterial infections**

**From secretions of dead body → Ebola**

**Intravenous catheters in hospitalized patients → local or systemic
infection**

**Needle sticks → HBV, HCV, HIV**

# UROGENITAL TRACT

![](img%5CTransmission-and-Dissemination-of-Microbes6.png)

# Urinary Tract Infections

**UT is invaded from the exterior by way of the urethra**

**Flushing of the urinary tract with urine serves as a defense against
invading microorganisms**

**Urine in the bladder is normally sterile**

**N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli adhere to the urinary epithelium**

# Anatomy is important in UT infection

- **Women have more than 10 times as many urinary tract infections as in
  men**
  - **Length of the urethra**
    - **5 cm in women, 20 cm in men**

# Urinary tract infections

- **Obstruction**
  - **compromise normal defenses**
  - **Increase susceptibility to urinary tract infections**
- **Spread in retrograde fashion**
  - **From the bladder up to the kidney**

# Vagina has normal flora

**Low pH**

**Catabolism of glycogen in the normal epithelium by lactobacilli**

**Normal under estrogen**

**Antibiotics kill the lactobacilli → Overgrowth of yeast → Vaginal
candidiasis**

# SPREAD AND DISSEMINATION OF MICROBES WITHIN THE BODY

![](img%5CTransmission-and-Dissemination-of-Microbes7.png)

# 

**Microorganisms proliferate locally, at the site of initial infection**

**Penetrate the epithelial barrier and spread to distant sites by way of
the lymphatics, the blood, or nerves**

- **Superficial infections stay confined to the lumen of hollow
  viscera**
  - **V. cholerae**
- **Adhere to, proliferate in or on epithelial cells**
  - **papillomaviruses, dermatophytes**

# Secrete lytic enzymes which destroy tissue and allow direct invasion

- **S. aureus**
  - **secretes hyaluronidase**
  - **degrades the extracellular matrix**

# Invasive microbes initially follow tissue planes of least resistance and drain to regional lymphatics

- **S. aureus**
  - **Travel from a localized abscess to the draining lymph nodes**
  - **Lead to bacteremia and spread to deep organs**
    - **heart, bone**

# Microorganisms spread in the blood or lymph either free in extracellular fluid or within host cells

- **Viruses**
  - **poliovirus, HBV**
- **Bacteria and fungi**

  virulent pathogens**
  - **fever, low blood pressure, and multiple other systemic signs and
    symptoms of sepsis**
- **Massive bloodstream invasion by bacteria can rapidly lead to fatal
  sepsis, even in previously healthy persons**

# Manifestations appear distant from the point of microbe entry

- **Varicella-zoster and measles**
  - **Enter through the airways → rashes in the skin**
- **Poliovirus**

# RELEASE FROM THE BODY AND TRANSMISSION OF MICROBES

# 

**Transmission depends on the hardiness of the microbe.**

survive in a cool and dry environment. **

person, often by direct contact.**
