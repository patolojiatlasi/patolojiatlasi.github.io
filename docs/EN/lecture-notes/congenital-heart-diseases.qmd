# Congenital heart diseases

# Surgery

__May correct the hemodynamic abnormalities__

__Repaired heart may not be completely normal__

__Myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling may be irreversible__

__All cardiac surgery results in some degree of myocardial scarring__

__Secondary arrhythmias\, ischemia\, and myocardial dysfunction\, appear many years after surgical correction__

# Pathogenesis

* __Faulty embryogenesis during gestational 3\-8 weeks__
* __Cause is unknown in almost 90% of cases__
* __Environmental causes__
  * __Congenital rubella infection__
  * __Teratogens__
  * __Maternal diabetes__
  * __Genetic factors are the best characterized__
    * __Familial forms of congenital heart disease__
    * __Trisomies 13\, 15\, 18\, and 21\, and Turner syndrome__

# Cardiac morphogenesis

* __Multiple genes__
  * __Commitment of progenitor cells to the myocardial lineage__
  * __Formation and looping of the heart tube__
  * __Segmentation and growth of the cardiac chambers__
  * __Cardiac valve formation__
  * __Connection of the great vessels to the heart__
  * __Mechanical force imparted by flowing pulsatile blood__

* __Multiple genes__

# Shunt

__abnormal communication between chambers or blood vessels__

__Abnormal channels permit blood flow down pressure gradients from the left \(systemic\) side to the right \(pulmonary\) side of the circulation or vice versa__

__Malformations causing a __  _left\-to\-right shunt_

__Malformations causing a __  _right\-to\-left shunt_

__Malformations causing an __  _obstruction_

![](img%5CCongenital-Heart-Diseases5.png)

# Left-to-right shunts

__Most common type of congenital cardiac malformation__

__Atrial septal defects__

__Ventricular septal defects__

__Patent ductus arteriosus__

__Cyanosis is not an early feature__

__Left\-to\-right shunting with volume and pressure overloads eventually causes pulmonary hypertension__

__Secondarily right\-sided pressures that exceed those on the left__

__Reversal of blood flow occurs\, right\-to\-left shunting\, cyanosis__

# 

__In contrast\, __  _left\-to\-right shunts_  __ \(e\.g\.\, ASD\, VSD\, and patent ductus arteriosus \[PDA\]\) increase pulmonary blood flow\, but are not __  _initially_  __ associated with cyanosis\. However\, left\-to\-right shunts chronically elevate both volume and pressure in the normally low\-pressure\, low\-resistance pulmonary circulation\. To maintain relatively normal distal pulmonary capillary and venous pressures\, the muscular pulmonary arteries \(<1 mm in diameter\) initially respond by undergoing medial hypertrophy and vasoconstriction\. However\, prolonged pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction stimulates the development of irreversible obstructive intimal lesions analogous to the arteriolar changes seen in systemic hypertension; pulmonary arteries can even develop frank atherosclerotic lesions \(__  _[Chapter 11](https://www.inkling.com/read/robbins-cotran-pathologic-basis-disease-professional-kumar-9/chapter-11/blood-vessels)_  __\)\. The right ventricle also responds to the pulmonary vascular changes by undergoing progressive right ventricular hypertrophy\. Eventually\, pulmonary vascular resistance approaches systemic levels\, and the original left\-to\-right shunt becomes a right\-to\-left shunt that introduces poorly oxygenated blood into the systemic circulation __  _\(Eisenmenger syndrome\)\._
