# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Intestines

- **Intestines face the “exterior” surface where many “foreign” elements
  to the body are located**
  - **Food, bacteria**
    - **Bacteria (beacteriom) outnumber the human cells (genome) by
      10x**
  - **Infections, inflamations**
    - **Incluiding inflamation against foreign elements, allergy**
- **Tubes**
  - **Absence of tube**
  - **Perforation**
  - **Duplication**
  - **Kink formation**
- **Living organs depending on circulation**
- **Subject to systemic disease**
- **Tumors**

# INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION

# Intestinal Obstruction

- **May occur at any level**
- **Small intestine is most often involved**
  - **Relatively narrow lumen**
- **Hernias, intestinal adhesions, intussusception, and volvulus account
  for 80% of mechanical obstructions**
- **Tumors and infarction account others**
- **Abdominal pain, distention, vomiting, and constipation**
- **Surgery is necessary for most cases**

# HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE

# Hirschsprung Disease

**1 of 5000 live births**

**Congenital defect in colonic innervation**

**May be isolated or occur in combination with other developmental
abnormalities**

**Common in males, more severe in females**

**Siblings of patients have an increased risk of Hirschsprung disease**

**Neonates with failure to pass meconium in the immediate postnatal
period**

**Obstructive constipation**

**Enterocolitis, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, perforation, and
peritonitis**

**Surgical resection of the aganglionic segment with anastomosis of the
normal colon to the rectum**

# Hirschsprung diseaseCongenital aganglionic megacolon

- **Enteric neuronal plexus**
- **Neural crest cells migrate into the bowel wall during
  embryogenesis**
- **Normal migration of neural crest cells from cecum to rectum is
  disrupted**
- **No Meissner submucosal plexus and the Auerbach myenteric plexus**
- **Coordinated peristaltic contractions are absent**
  - **Functional obstruction**
  - **Dilation proximal to the affected segment**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the receptor tyrosine
  kinase RET**
  - **majority of familial cases**
  - **15% of sporadic cases**
- **Most cases are limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon**
  - **Severe disease can involve the entire colon**
  - **Always affects the rectum**
  - **Length of the additional involved segments varies**
- **Aganglionic region may have a grossly normal or contracted
  appearance**
- **Normally innervated proximal colon may undergo progressive dilation
  as a result of the distal obstruction**
- **Diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease requires demonstrating the absence
  of ganglion cells in the affected segment**

# ABDOMINAL HERNIA

# Abdominal Hernia

**Inguinal and femoral canals**

**Umbilicus**

**Sites of surgical scars**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **External herniation**
- **Visceral protrusion**
- **Inguinal hernias**
  - **Small bowel loops are herniated**
  - **portions of omentum**
  - **large bowel**
- **When organs entrapped → Impaired venous drainage → stasis and edema
  → increase the bulk of the herniated loop → permanent entrapment,
  incarceration → arterial and venous compromise, strangulation →
  infarction**

# ISCHEMIC BOWEL DISEASE

# Ischemic Bowel Disease

- **Ischemic damage**
- **Mucosal infarction**
  - **Up to muscularis mucosa**
- **Mural infarction**
  - **Mucosa and submucosa**
- **Transmural infarction**
  - **All three layers of the wall**

**Secondary to acute or chronic hypoperfusion**

**Acute vascular obstruction**

- **Causes of acute arterial obstruction**
  - **Severe atherosclerosis, at the origin of mesenteric vessels**
  - **Aortic aneurysm**

    hypoxia**
- **Second phase, reperfusion injury**
  - **Restoration of the blood supply**
  - **Associated with the greatest damage**
  - **May lead to multiorgan failure**
  - **Free radical production, neutrophil infiltration, and release of
    inflammatory mediators, such as complement proteins and cytokines**
- **Severity of ischemic bowel disease depend on**
  - **Time frame**
  - **Vessels affected**
- **Watershed zones**
  - **Splenic flexure, where the superior and inferior mesenteric
    arterial circulations terminate**
  - **Sigmoid colon and rectum where inferior mesenteric, pudendal, and
    iliac arterial circulations end**
  - **Generalized hypotension or hypoxemia cause localized injury, and
    ischemic disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis
    for focal colitis of the splenic flexure or rectosigmoid colon**

**Transmural infarct of the cecum**

**Yellow exudates**

**Necrotic purple-red mucosa**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

- **Intestinal capillaries run alongside the glands, from crypt to
  surface**
  - **Make a hairpin turn at the surface**
  - **Empty into the postcapillary venules**
- **Oxygenated blood to supplied to crypts but leaves the surface
  epithelium vulnerable to ischemic injury**
  - **Protects the crypts**
    - **Contain the epithelial stem cells**
  - **Surface epithelial atrophy, necrosis, consequent sloughing**
  - **Normal or hyperproliferative crypts**

**Increased susceptibility of watershed zones, but may occur anywhere**

**Segmental and patchy in distribution**

**Mucosa is hemorrhagic and often ulcerated**

**Edema that may involve the mucosa or extend into the submucosa and
muscularis propria**

**Extensive mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage and necrosis**

**Serosal hemorrhage and serositis generally are absent**

- **Damage is more in acute arterial thrombosis and transmural
  infarction**
- **Blood-tinged mucus or blood accumulates within the lumen**
- **Coagulative necrosis of the muscularis propria occurs within 1 to 4
  days**
  - **associated with purulent serositis and perforation**
- **Mesenteric venous thrombosis**
  - **Arterial blood continues to flow for a time**
  - **Less abrupt transition from affected to normal bowel**
  - **Impaired venous drainage eventually prevents entry of oxygenated
    arterial blood**

**Atrophy or sloughing of surface epithelium**

**Crypts may be hyperproliferative**

similar to ischemic disease**

**Presence of bizarre “radiation fibroblasts” within the stroma**

# Necrotizing enterocolitis

**Acute disorder of the small and large intestines**

**Transmural necrosis**

**Most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency of neonates**

**Premature or of low birth weight**

**Occurs most often when oral feeding is initiated**

**Ischemic injury generally is considered to contribute to its
pathogenesis**

# Angiodysplasia

- **Malformed submucosal and mucosal blood vessels**
- **Cecum or right colon**
- **Presents after the sixth decade of life**
- **Prevalence of angiodysplasia is \<1% in the adult population**
  - **but 20% of major episodes of lower intestinal bleeding**

# DIVERTICULITIS

# Diverticulitis

- **Acquired pseudodiverticular outpouchings of the colonic mucosa and
  submucosa**
- **Rare \<30 years of age**
- **Prevalence approaches 50% in Western adult populations \>60 age**
- **Generally multiple, diverticulosis**
- **Much less common in Japan and nonindustrialized countries**
  - **dietary differences**
- **Elevated intraluminal pressure in the sigmoid colon**
- **Nerves, arterial vasa recta, and their connective tissue sheaths
  penetrate the inner circular muscle coat to create discontinuities in
  the muscle wall**
- **In other parts of the intestine, these gaps are reinforced by the
  external longitudinal layer of the muscularis propria**
  - **In the colon, this muscle layer is discontinuous, taeniae coli**
- **High luminal pressures, by exaggerated peristaltic contractions,
  with spasmodic sequestration of bowel segments**

![](./img-local/Pathology-of-the-Small-Intestines%2C-Colon-and-Appendix19.png)

**Small, flask-like outpouchings**

**Usually 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter**

**Regular distribution in between the taeniae coli**

- **Most common in the sigmoid colon, but other regions of the colon may
  be affected in severe cases**

- **Compressible, easily emptied of fecal contents, often surrounded by
  the fat-containing epiploic appendices on the surface of the colon**

- **Hypertrophy of the circular layer of the muscularis propria in the
  affected bowel segment**

- **Obstruction of diverticula → inflammatory changes → diverticulitis
  and peridiverticulitis → lead to perforation**

- **With or without perforation, recurrent diverticulitis cause
  segmental colitis**
