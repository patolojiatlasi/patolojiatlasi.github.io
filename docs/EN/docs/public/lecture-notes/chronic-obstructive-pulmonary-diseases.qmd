__Robbins Basic Pathology__

## EMPHYSEMA

## Emphysema

__Abnormal permanent enlargement of the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles__

__Destruction of alveoli walls without significant fibrosis__

## Types of Emphysema

* __Clinically significant airway obstruction__
* __Centriacinar emphysema__
  * __20x more common__
  * __95% of clinically significant cases__

__Centriacinar__

__Panacinar__

__Distal acinar__

__Irregular__

__distention of all the peripheral structures; later extends to respiratory bronchioles__

__dilation that initially affects the respiratory bronchioles__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

__Centriacinar emphysema: Central areas show marked emphysematous damage\, surrounded by relatively spared alveolar spaces__

## Centriacinar (Centrilobular) Emphysema

__Central\, proximal parts of the acini__

__Respiratory bronchioles are affected__

__Distal alveoli are spared__

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases9.png)

__Both emphysematous and normal air spaces exist within the same acinus and lobule__

* __More common and severe in the upper lobes\, apical segments__
* __In severe cases distal acinus also involved__
  * __Differentiation from panacinar emphysema becomes difficult__

__Cigarette smoking__

__Panacinar \(Panlobular\) emphysema__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases12.png)

__Panacinar emphysema: involving the entire pulmonary lobule__

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases13.png)

## Panacinar (Panlobular) Emphysema

* __Acini are uniformly enlarged__
  * __From respiratory bronchiole to terminal blind alveoli__
* __More commonly in the lower lung zones\, anterior margins__
* __Associated with__
  * __α1\-antitrypsin deficiency__

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases14.png)

## Distal Acinar (Paraseptal) Emphysema

__Proximal portion is normal__

__Distal part is primarily involved__

__More striking adjacent to the pleura\, along the lobular connective tissue septa\, and at the margins of the lobules__

__Occurs adjacent to areas of fibrosis\, scarring\, or atelectasis__

__More severe in the upper half of the lungs__

__Multiple\, contiguous\, enlarged air spaces__

__0\.5 mm \- >2\.0 cm__

__Cystic structures__

__Progressive enlargement__

__Bullae__

__Cause is unknown__

__Most often in spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults__

## Irregular Emphysema

* __Acinus is irregularly involved__
* __Associated with scarring__
* __Healed inflammatory diseases__
* __Clinically asymptomatic__
  * __Most common form of emphysema__

## Pathogenesis of Emphysema

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases17.png)

* __Exposure to toxic substances__
  * __Tobacco smoke\, inhaled pollutants__
  * __Ongoing inflammation__
  * __Accumulation of neutrophils\, macrophages and lymphocytes__
  * __Elastases\, cytokines \(IL\-8\)\, oxidants are released__
  * __Epithelial injury and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix__

## Emphysema

__Elastin degradation products increase the inflammation__

__80% of patients with congenital α1\-antitrypsin \(antielastase\) deficiency develop symptomatic panacinar emphysema__

__Earlier age and with greater severity if the affected person smokes__

__TGFB gene polymorphisms influence susceptibility to COPD__

__MMP\-9 and MMP\-12__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Emphysema__

__Fibrosing lung diseases__

* __Tissue destruction without fibrosis__
* __Loss of epithelial and endothelial cells__
* __Also loss of mesenchymal cells__
  * __Lack of extracellular matrix__
  * __Emphysema can be thought as an insufficient wound repair__

* __Tissue destruction with interstitial fibrosis __
  * __Excessive myofibroblastic or fibroblastic response to injury__
  * __Scarring__

## Airway obstruction in emphysema

* __Normally: Small airways are held open bu the elastic recoil of parenchyma__
* __Emphysema:__
  * __Loss of elastic tissue__
  * __During respiration respiratory bronchioles collapse__
  * __Functional airway obstruction occurs\, despite there is no mechanical obstruction__
  * __There is also narrowing of lumen due to ongoing chronic inflammatory changes__

## Macroscopic appearance

* __Panacinar emphysema__
  * __Pale\, voluminous lungs__
  * __Obscure the heart when the anterior chest wall is removed at autopsy__
* __Centriacinar emphysema __
  * __Upper two thirds of the lungs are more severely affected than the lower lungs__

## Histologic examination

* __Destruction of alveolar walls without fibrosis\, leading to enlarged air spaces__
* __Alveolar loss__
* __The number of alveolar capillaries is diminished__
* __Terminal and respiratory bronchioles deformed__
  * __Loss of septa__
  * __Collapse during expiration__
* __Bronchiolar inflammation and submucosal fibrosis in advanced disease__

## Conditions Related to Emphysema

* __Compensatory emphysema__
  * __Response to loss of lung substance__
  * __Surgical removal of a diseased lung or lobe__
* __Obstructive overinflation__
  * __Lung expands because air is trapped within it__
  * __Tumor or foreign object__

* __Bullous emphysema__
  * __Any form of emphysema produces large subpleural blebs or bullae__
  * __Greater than 1 cm in diameter in the distended state__
  * __May rupture\, leading to pneumothorax__

__Emphysematous bullae__

__Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas__

* __Mediastinal \(interstitial\) emphysema__
  * __Air enters the connective tissue stroma of the lung\, mediastinum\, and subcutaneous tissue__
  * __Spontaneously with a sudden increase in intra\-alveolar pressure → tear → air enters into tissue__
    * __vomiting or violent coughing__
    * __children with whooping cough__
    * __patients on respirators who have partial bronchiolar obstruction__
    * __perforating injury__

__Interstitial pulmonary emphysema__

## CHRONIC BRONCHITIS

## Chronic Bronchitis

__Clinical definition: Persistant cough with sputum\, at least 3 months\, at least 2 consecutive years\, absence of any identifiable cause__

__Cigarette smokers__

__Urban\, smog\-ridden cities__

__20\-25% of men in 40\-65\-year\-old age have the disease__

* __Hypersecretion of mucus__
  * __Beginning in the large airways__
* __Hypertrophy of mucous glands in the trachea and main bronchi__
* __Increase in mucin\-secreting goblet cells in the surface epithelium of smaller bronchi and bronchioles__
* __Inflammation with infiltration of CD8\+ lymphocytes\, macrophages\, and neutrophils__
  * __No eosinophils in contrast to asthma __

* __Mucus hypersecretion is primarily a reflection of large bronchial involvement__
* __Morphologic basis of airflow obstruction in chronic bronchitis is more peripheral:__
* __Small airway disease__
  * __Goblet cell metaplasia__
  * __Mucous plugging of the bronchiolar lumen__
  * __Inflammation\, and bronchiolar wall fibrosis__
* __Coexistent emphysema__
  * __Chronic bronchiolitis__
  * __Almost always complicated by emphysema__

* __Effects of environmental irritants__
  * __T cell cytokines \-\->  IL\-13__
  * __Transcription of the mucin gene MUC5AC in bronchial epithelium__
  * __Production of neutrophil elastase__
* __Microbial infection has a secondary role__

__Chronic bronchitis: Marked thickening of the mucous gland layer \(approximately twice\-normal\) and squamous metaplasia of lung epithelium__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

* __Mucosal lining of the larger airways__
  * __hyperemic and swollen by edema fluid__
  * __covered by a layer of mucinous or mucopurulent secretions__
* __Smaller bronchi and bronchioles__
  * __filled with similar secretions__
* __The diagnostic feature of chronic bronchitis in the trachea and larger bronchi → enlargement of the mucus\-secreting glands__
  * __Reid index increased__
    * __Ratio of the thickness of the submucosal gland layer to that of the bronchial wall__
    * __normally 0\.4__
* __Inflammatory cells\, largely mononuclear\, neutrophils__
