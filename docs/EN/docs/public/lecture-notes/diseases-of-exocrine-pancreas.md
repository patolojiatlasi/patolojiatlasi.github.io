# Diseases of Exocrine Pancreas

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Pancreas

- **Exocrine organ**
  - **Acinar cells**
    - **Produce the digestive enzymes**
  - **Ductules and ducts**
    - **Cuboidal cells lining the smaller ductules secrete
      bicarbonate-rich fluid**
    - **Columnar cells lining the larger ducts produce mucin**
    - **Larger ducts also express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
      conductance regulator (CFTR)**
      - **aberrant function of this membrane protein affects the
        viscosity of the pancreatic secretions**
- **Endocrine organ**
  - \_\_ islets of Langerhans\_\_
  - **secrete insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin**

# İnhibitors of autodigestion of the pancreas

**Pancreatic enzymes are synthesized as inactive proenzymes**

**Sequestered in membrane-bound zymogen granules**

**Activation of proenzymes requires conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin
by duodenal enteropeptidase (enterokinase)**

**Trypsin inhibitors (e.g., SPINK1, also known as pancreatic secretory
trypsin inhibitor) are secreted by acinar and ductal cells**

**Trypsin cleaves and inactivates itself**

**Acinar cells are remarkably resistant to the action of activated
enzymes**

# Cystic Fibrosis

**Cystic fibrosis**

**The acinar tissue of the pancreas has been replaced by adipose
tissue.**

**Pancreas in cystic fibrosis. The ducts are dilated and plugged with
eosinophilic mucin, and the parenchymal glands are atrophic and replaced
by fibrous tissue.**

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

# CONGENITAL ANOMALIES

# Agenesis

**Very rarely**

**totally absent**

**usually associated with additional severe malformations that are
incompatible with life**

**Pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 is a homeodomain transcription factor,
mutations of the PDX1 gene, located on chromosomal locus 13q12.1**

# Pancreas Divisum

**most common clinically significant congenital pancreatic anomaly**

**incidence of 3-10% in autopsy series**

**duct systems of the fetal pancreatic primordia fail to fuse**

**main pancreatic duct drains only a small portion of the head of the
gland**

**bulk of the pancreas (from the dorsal pancreatic primordium) drains
through the minor sphincter, which has a narrow opening**

**elevated intraductal pressures throughout most of the pancreas**

**increased risk for chronic pancreatitis**

# Annular Pancreas

**uncommon variant of pancreatic fusion**

**ring of pancreatic tissue completely encircles the duodenum**

**manifest with signs and symptoms of duodenal obstruction such as
gastric distention and vomiting**

# Ectopic Pancreas

**2% of the population**

**stomach and duodenum, jejunum, Meckel diverticulum, and ileum**

**embryologic rests**

**small (ranging from millimeters to centimeters in diameter)**

**submucosa**

**normal pancreatic acini with occasional islets**

**usually incidental and asymptomatic**

**can cause pain from localized inflammation, rarely bleeding**

**2% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors arise in ectopic pancreatic
tissue**

# Congenital Cysts

**anomalous development of the pancreatic ducts**

**may be with polycystic diseases**

**generally unilocular and range from microscopic to 5 cm in diameter**

**lined by either uniform cuboidal or flattened epithelium**

**enclosed in a thin, fibrous capsule**

**contain clear serous fluid**

# PANCREATITIS

# Acute Pancreatitis

- **reversible inflammatory disorder**
- **varies in severity**
- **focal edema and fat necrosis to widespread hemorrhagic parenchymal
  necrosis**
- **relatively common**
  - **10-20 per 100,000 people in the Western world**
- **80% of cases are attributable to either biliary tract disease or
  alcoholism**
  - **5% of patients with gallstones develop acute pancreatitis**
    - **gallstones are implicated in 35-60% of cases overall**
  - **Excessive alcohol intake**
    - **65% of cases in the United States, 5% or less in the United
      Kingdom**

# Other causes of acute pancreatitis

- **Non–gallstone-related obstruction of the pancreatic ducts**
  - **ampullary region neoplasms, pancreatic cancer, pancreas divisum,
    biliary “sludge,” or parasites, Ascaris lumbricoides and Clonorchis
    sinensis**
- **Medications**
  - **anticonvulsants, cancer chemotherapeutic agents, thiazide
    diuretics, estrogens, .... **
- **Infections**
  - **mumps virus or coxsackievirus**
- **Metabolic disorders**
  - **hypertriglyceridemia, hyperparathyroidism, and other hypercalcemic
    states**
- **Ischemia**
  - **vascular thrombosis, embolism, vasculitis, or shock**

- **Inherited mutations**
  - **genes encoding pancreatic enzymes or their inhibitors (e.g.,
    SPINK1 )**
  - **Hereditary pancreatitis**
    - **autosomal dominant disease with 80% penetrance**
    - **recurrent attacks of severe pancreatitis**
    - **beginning in childhood**
    - **mutations in the gene PRSS1 , which encodes trypsinogen, the
      proenzyme of pancreatic trypsin. Trypsin cannot cleave and
      inactivate itself**
- **10-20% of acute pancreatitis idiopathic **

# Acute Pancreatitis

**microvascular leakage causing edema**

**necrosis of fat by lipases**

**an acute inflammatory reaction**

**proteolytic destruction of pancreatic parenchyma**

**destruction of blood vessels leading to interstitial hemorrhage**

![](img%5CDiseases-of-Exocrine-Pancreas9.jpg)

**The microscopic field shows a region of fat necrosis (right) and focal
pancreatic parenchymal necrosis (center).**

**Fat necrosis results from enzymatic destruction of fat cells; the
released fatty acids combine with calcium to form insoluble salts that
precipitate in situ**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CDiseases-of-Exocrine-Pancreas10.png)

**The pancreas has been sectioned longitudinally to reveal dark areas of
hemorrhage in the pancreatic substance and a focal area of pale fat
necrosis in the peripancreatic fat (upper left).**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **More severe form → Acute necrotizing pancreatitis**
- **Necrosis of pancreatic tissue affects acinar and ductal tissues as
  well as the islets of Langerhans**
- **Vascular damage causes hemorrhage into the parenchyma of the
  pancreas**
- **Macroscopically, the pancreas exhibits red-black hemorrhagic areas
  interspersed with foci of yellow-white, chalky fat necrosis**
- **Fat necrosis also can occur in extrapancreatic fat, including the
  omentum and bowel mesentery, and even outside the abdominal cavity
  (e.g., in subcutaneous fat)**
- **Peritoneum contains a serous, slightly turbid, brown-tinged fluid
  with globules of fat (derived from enzymatically digested adipose
  tissue)**
- **Most severe form → hemorrhagic pancreatitis**
  - **extensive parenchymal necrosis, diffuse hemorrhage within the
    substance of the gland**

# Pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis

- **autodigestion of the pancreatic substance by inappropriately
  activated pancreatic enzymes**
- **activation of trypsin is a critical triggering event in acute
  pancreatitis**
- **trypsin is inappropriately generated from its proenzyme
  trypsinogen**
  - **can activate itself and other proenzymes (phospholipases and
    elastases)**
  - **converts prekallikrein to its activated form, kinin system**
  - **activation of factor XII (Hageman factor), clotting and complement
    systems**

**Impaction of a gallstone or biliary sludge**

**extrinsic compression of the ductal system**

**blocks ductal flow**

**increases intraductal pressure**

**accumulation of an enzyme-rich interstitial fluid**

**lipase is secreted in an active form, local fat necrosis**

**Injured tissues, periacinar myofibroblasts, and leukocytes release
pro-inflammatory cytokines**

**local inflammation and interstitial edema through a leaky
microvasculature**

**Edema compromises local blood flow**

**vascular insufficiency and ischemic injury to acinar cells**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CDiseases-of-Exocrine-Pancreas15.png)

**Ischemia, viral infections (mumps), drugs, and direct trauma to the
pancreas are important in acinar cell injury mechanism**

- **Pancreatic proenzymes and lysosomal hydrolases become packaged
  together**
- **Proenzyme activation**
- **Lysosomal rupture**
  - **phospholipases**
- **Local release of activated enzymes**
- **The role of this mechanism in human acute pancreatitis is not
  clear**

# Pancreatic Pseudocysts

- **common sequela of acute pancreatitis**

  - **in particular, alcoholic pancreatitis**

- **Liquefied areas of necrotic pancreatic tissue become walled off by
  fibrous tissue to form a cystic space**

- **No epithelial lining**

- **cyst contents are rich in pancreatic enzymes, and a laboratory
  assessment of the cyst aspirate can be diagnostic**

- **75% of all pancreatic cysts**

- **Many pseudocysts spontaneously resolve**

- **become secondarily infected**

- **larger pseudocysts can compress or even perforate into adjacent
  structures**

- **solitary**

- **attached to the surface of the gland**

- **involve peripancreatic tissues**

  - **lesser omental sac**
  - **retroperitoneum between the stomach and transverse colon or
    liver**

- **2 cm - 30 cm**

  - **chronic malabsorption**
- **In its late stages, the endocrine parenchyma also lost**
  - **diabetes mellitus**
- **Recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis cause chronic pancreatitis**

![](img%5CDiseases-of-Exocrine-Pancreas23.png)

**In chronic pancreatitis irreversible impairment in pancreatic
function**

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Diseases**

- **Most common cause is long-term alcohol abuse**
  - **middle-aged men**
- **Long-standing pancreatic duct obstruction**
  - **pseudocysts, calculi, neoplasms, or pancreas divisum**
- **Tropical pancreatitis**
  - **heterogeneous disorder seen in Africa and Asia**
  - **subset of cases having a genetic basis**
- **Hereditary pancreatitis**
  - **mutations in the pancreatic trypsinogen gene ( PRRS1 )**
  - **SPINK1 gene encoding a trypsin inhibitor**
- **Chronic pancreatitis associated with CFTR mutations**
  - **cystic fibrosis → decrease bicarbonate secretion → increase the
    viscosity of the secretions → promoting protein plugging**
- **40% have no recognizable predisposing factors**
  - **may be associated with unknown inherited mutations**

**Chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas becomes hard and gray and contains
numerous areas of mineralization. Ducts are cystically dilated and
contain scattered calculi.**

**Extensive fibrosis and atrophy has left only residual islets (left)
and ducts (right), with a sprinkling of chronic inflammatory cells and
acinar tissue.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CDiseases-of-Exocrine-Pancreas26.jpg)

**parenchymal fibrosis**

**reduced number and size of acini**

**variable dilation of the pancreatic ducts**

**relative sparing of the islets of Langerhans**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CDiseases-of-Exocrine-Pancreas27.jpg)

**Remaining islets of Langerhans become embedded in the sclerotic tissue
and may fuse and appear enlarged; eventually they also disappear**

**Acinar loss, with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate around remaining
lobules and ducts**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

![](img%5CDiseases-of-Exocrine-Pancreas28.jpg)

**The ductal epithelium may be atrophied or hyperplastic or exhibit
squamous metaplasia, and ductal concretions may be noted**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**
