# Vascular injury

__Endothelial cell loss or dysfunction__

__Stimulates smooth muscle cell growth and associated matrix synthesis__

__Migration of smooth muscle cells or smooth muscle cell precursor cells into the intima\.__

__These cells proliferate\, and synthesize ECM similar to fibroblasts fill in a wound__

__Form a neointima\, covered by an intact endothelial cell layer__

* __Neointimal response occurs with any form of vascular damage or dysfunction__
* __Infection__
* __Inflammation__
* __Immune injury__
* __Physical trauma__
  * __Balloon catheter\, hypertension__
* __Toxic exposure__
  * __Oxidized lipids\, cigarette smoke__

# Neointimal smooth muscle cells

* __Do not have capacity to contract like medial smooth muscle cells__
* __Have capacity to divide__

* __A subset is derived from circulating precursor cells__
* __Migratory\, proliferative\, and synthetic activities of the intimal smooth muscle cells are regulated by__
  * __growth factors and cytokines produced by platelets\, endothelial cells\, macrophages\, activated coagulation and complement factors__

# After endothelial layer is restored

__No more muscle proliferation__

__Thickened neointima stays__
