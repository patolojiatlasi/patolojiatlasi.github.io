# DRUG- OR TOXIN-INDUCED LIVER DISEASE

# Drug- or Toxin-Induced Liver Disease

- **Liver is the major detoxifying organ**
- **Injury may result from;**
- **Direct toxicity**
- **Hepatic conversion of a xenobiotic to an active toxin**
- **By immune mechanisms**
  - **a drug or a metabolite acting as a hapten to convert a cellular
    protein into an immunogen**
- **Diagnosis depends on**
  - **Association of agent and liver injury in terms of time**
  - **Recovery on removal of the compound**
  - **Exclusion of other causes**
- **Should be in differential diagnosis list always**
- **Most important agent that produces toxic liver injury is alcohol**

# Drug-induced liver disease

- **Common condition**
- **May manifest as**
  - **A mild reaction**
  - **Acute liver failure**
  - **Chronic liver disease**
- **Caused by:**
  - **Drugs or medicines**
  - **Herbal remedies**
  - **Dietary supplements**
  - **Topical applications (e.g., ointments, perfumes, shampoo)**
  - **Environmental exposures (e.g., cleaning solvents, pesticides,
    fertilizers)**

# Drug reactions

- **Predictable**
  - **Dose-dependent**
- **Unpredictable (idiosyncratic)**
  - **Individual host variations**
  - **Immune response to drug-related antigen**
  - **The rate at which the agent is metabolized**
- **Both classes of injury may be immediate or take weeks to months to
  develop**

**Many drugs cause hepatic injury**

**For updated information **

# Predictable

- **Acetaminophen**
  - **Most common cause of acute liver failure necessitating
    transplantation in the United States**
  - **Intentional suicidal overdoses are common, so are accidental
    overdoses**
  - **Codeine, alcohol upregulate P-450 system → acetaminophen is more
    toxic**
- **The toxic agent is not acetaminophen itself but toxic metabolites
  produced by the cytochrome P-450 system in acinus zone 3 hepatocytes**
- **These cells die, the zone 2 hepatocytes take over this metabolic
  function, in turn**
- **In severe overdoses the zone of injury extends to the periportal
  hepatocytes, resulting in fulminant hepatic failure**

# Idiosyncratic

- **Chlorpromazine**
  - **causes cholestasis in individuals who metabolize it slowly**
- **Halothane**
  - **fatal immune-mediated hepatitis**
- **Sulfonamides**
- **α-methyldopa**
- **Idiosyncratic drug or toxin reactions involve a variable combination
  of**
  - **Direct cytotoxicity**
  - **Immune-mediated hepatocyte or bile duct destruction**

**Depending on the toxic material different zones may be affected**

**If the toxin is a metabolite of a drug then it may accumulate in zone
3 and most severe effect is seen in zone 3**

# ALCOHOLIC AND NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE

# Fatty Liver Disease

- **Alcohol**
  - **Steatosis**
  - **Steatohepatitis**
  - **Cirrhosis**
- **Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**
  - **Similar hepatic changes with alcohol**
  - **Associated with metabolic syndrome**
    - **insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
      and dyslipidemia**

# Hepatocellular Steatosis

- **Fat accumulation typically begins in centrilobular hepatocytes**
- **Small (microvesicular), large (macrovesicular)**
- **Later midlobule and then the periportal regions**
- **Macroscopically, the fatty liver with widespread steatosis**
  - **Large (weighing 4 to 6 kg or more), soft, yellow, and greasy**

![](./img-local/Inflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver7.png)

**Fatty liver disease. Macrovesicular steatosis is most prominent around
the central vein and extends outward to the portal tracts with
increasing severity. The intracytoplasmic fat is seen as clear vacuoles.
Some fibrosis (stained blue) is present in a characteristic
perisinusoidal “chicken wire fence” pattern.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Steatohepatitis

**More with alcohol use than in NAFLD**

**Hepatocyte ballooning**

**Mallory-Denk bodies**

**Neutrophilic reaction**

- **Hepatocyte ballooning**
  - **Single or scattered foci of cells undergo swelling and necrosis**
  - **Start from centrilobular areas**
- **Mallory-Denk bodies**
  - **tangled intermediate filaments**
  - **eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in degenerating hepatocytes**

**keratins 8 and 18 **

**ballooned hepatocytes **

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Neutrophil infiltration

**Predominantly neutrophilic infiltration may permeate the lobule**

**Accumulate around degenerating hepatocytes, particularly those
containing Mallory-Denk bodies**

**Lymphocytes and macrophages also may be seen in portal tracts or
parenchyma**

# Steatohepatitis with fibrosis

**First in the centrilobular region, central vein sclerosis**

**Perisinusoidal scar appears in the space of Disse of the centrilobular
region**

**Spreads outward, encircling individual or small clusters of
hepatocytes in a chicken wire fence pattern**

**Link to portal tracts**

**Condense to create central-portal fibrous septa**

**Liver takes on a nodular, cirrhotic appearance**

**Classic micronodular or Laennec cirrhosis**

# Course of Fatty Liver Disease

- **Early**
  - **the liver is yellow-tan, fatty, and enlarged**
- **Later**
  - **Persistent damage**
  - **Brown, shrunken, nonfatty organ composed of cirrhotic nodules that
    are usually less than 0.3 cm in diameter, smaller than is typical
    for most chronic viral hepatitis **
  - **End-stage cirrhotic liver may enter into a “burned-out” phase**
  - **No fatty change and other typical features**

**Steatosis or fatty change imparts a yellow to orange cast to the liver
parenchyma**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

**Alcoholic cirrhosis**

**Diffuse nodularity. Average nodule size is 3 mm. Greenish because of
bile stasis**

![](./img-local/Inflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver11.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Steatohepatitis leading to cirrhosis. Small nodules are entrapped in
blue-staining fibrous tissue; fatty accumulation is no longer seen in
this “burned-out” stage**

# Alcoholic liver disease

**Steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and fibrosis may develop
independently**

**Not necessarily represent a continuum of changes**

**Hepatocellular carcinoma arises in 10-20% of patients with alcoholic
cirrhosis**

**Alcoholic liver disease**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Causes of hepatocellular steatosis

- **Shunting of substrates away from catabolism and toward lipid
  biosynthesis**
  - **Generation of excess reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide**
    - **metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde
      dehydrogenase**
- **Impaired assembly and secretion of lipoproteins**
- **Increased peripheral catabolism of fat**

# Causes of alcoholic hepatitis

- **Acetaldehyde**
  - **metabolite of ethanol**
  - **induces lipid peroxidation and acetaldehyde-protein adduct
    formation**
  - **disrupt cytoskeleton and membrane function**
- **Alcohol directly affects**
  - **cytoskeleton**
    - **Mallory-Denk bodies**
  - **mitochondrial function**
  - **membrane fluidity**
- **Reactive oxygen species**
  - **oxidation of ethanol by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system**
  - **neutrophils, areas of hepatocyte necrosis**
- **Cytokine-mediated inflammation and cell injury**
  - **TNF**
  - **IL-1, IL-6, IL-8**
- **Generation of acetaldehyde and free radicals is maximal in the
  centrilobular region, this region is most susceptible to toxic injury.
  Pericellular fibrosis and sinusoidal fibrosis develop in this area of
  the lobule.**
- **Concurrent viral hepatitis, hepatitis C, is a major accelerator of
  liver disease in alcoholics**

# Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

- **Metabolic syndrome**
  - **Having at least two of the following:**
    - **Obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension**
- **Insulin resistance results in the accumulation of triglycerides in
  hepatocytes**
  - **Impaired oxidation of fatty acids**
  - **Increased synthesis and uptake of fatty acids**
  - **Decreased hepatic secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein
    cholesterol**
- **Fat-laden hepatocytes**
  - **highly sensitive to lipid peroxidation products generated by
    oxidative stress**
  - **damage mitochondrial and plasma membranes, causing apoptosis**
- **Most common cause of incidental elevation of serum transaminases**
- **Significant contributor to the pathogenesis of “cryptogenic”
  cirrhosis**
- **Pediatric NAFLD**
  - **Increasing problem as metabolic syndrome and NAFLD approach
    epidemic proportions**
  - **In children**
    - **Inflammation and scarring tend to be more prominent in the
      portal tracts and periportal regions**
    - **Mononuclear infiltrates rather than neutrophilic infiltrates
      predominate**

# Drug/Toxin-Mediated Injury with Steatosis

- **Mitochondrial injury leading to diffuse, hepatocellular
  microvesicular steatosis**
- **Associated with severe and potentially fatal acute liver
  dysfunction**
- **Reye syndrome**
  - **\<4 age**
  - **viral illness**
  - **Pernicious vomiting, irritability or lethargy and hepatomegaly**
  - **Serum bilirubin, ammonia, and aminotransferase levels are
    essentially normal at presentation**
  - **25% progress to coma, accompanied by elevations in the serum
    levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases, and particularly ammonia**
  - **Death occurs from progressive neurologic deterioration or liver
    failure**
- **Reye syndrome has been associated with aspirin administration**
- **No definitive evidence that salicylates play a causal role in this
  disorder**
- **Aspirin is contraindicated in children and teenagers with febrile
  illnesses**
- **Similar mitochondrial dysfunction caused by**
  - **Tetracycline and valproate**
  - **Toxins in unripe ackee fruit, popular in Jamaica**
  - **Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens for HIV**
    - **same histologic injuries**
    - **but, spared significant morbidity**

![](./img-local/Inflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver18.png)

- **Hepatocellular microvesicular steatosis**
  - **Electron microscopy of hepatocellular mitochondria**
    - **pleomorphic enlargement and electron lucency of the matrices**
    - **disruption of cristae and loss of dense bodies**
- **Cerebral edema**
  - **Astrocytes are swollen**
  - **mitochondrial changes similar to those seen in the liver**
  - **Inflammation is notably absent**
- **Skeletal muscles, kidneys, and heart also may reveal microvesicular
  fatty change and mitochondrial alterations**

# INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASES

# Hemochromatosis

- **Excessive accumulation of body iron**
- **Deposited in the liver, pancreas, and heart**
- **Most common form is an autosomal recessive disease of adult onset**
  - **mutations in the HFE gene**
- **Secondary iron overload**
  - **multiple transfusions, ineffective erythropoiesis (as in
    β-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes), and increased iron
    intake**

# Hereditary Hemochromatosis

- **Iron accumulates over the lifetime of the affected person**
- **Excessive intestinal absorption**
- **Total iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which is
  found in the liver**
- **Fully developed cases**
  - **cirrhosis (seen in all patients)**
  - **diabetes mellitus (in 75% to 80% of patients)**
  - **skin pigmentation (in 75% to 80%)**

![](./img-local/Inflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver19.png)

**HFE gene**

**Located on the short arm of chromosome 6**

**Encodes a protein that is similar in structure to MHC class I
proteins**

**Expression of the mutated HFE protein on small intestinal enterocytes
leads to inappropriately upregulated absorption of iron and its binding
to transferrin**

**HFE and the other genes involved in less common forms of hereditary
hemochromatosis all regulate the levels of hepcidin, the iron hormone
produced by the liver**

**Hepcidin normally down-regulates the efflux of iron from the
intestines and macrophages into the plasma and inhibits iron
absorption**

**When hepcidin levels are reduced there is increased iron absorption**

**Excessive iron directly toxic to tissues**

**Lipid peroxidation by iron-catalyzed free radical reactions**

**Stimulation of collagen formation**

**Direct interactions of iron with DNA**

# Hemochromatosis

- **Deposition of hemosiderin**
- **Liver, pancreas, myocardium, pituitary, adrenal, thyroid and
  parathyroid glands, joints, skin, testis**
- **Liver**
  - **Golden-yellow hemosiderin granules in the cytoplasm of periportal
    hepatocytes, which stain blue with the Prussian blue stain**
  - **Progressive involvement of the rest of the lobule**
  - **Bile duct epithelium**
  - **Kupffer cells**

**Accumulation of iron results in a rusty brown liver **

![](./img-local/Inflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver20.png)

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

![](./img-local/Inflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver21.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Iron is a direct hepatotoxin, and inflammation is characteristically
absent**

**Liver typically is slightly larger than normal, dense, and chocolate
brown**

**Fibrous septa develop slowly**

**Cirrhosis in an intensely pigmented (very dark brown to black) liver**

**Dry weight:**

**Normal iron content of unfixed liver tissue \<1000 µg/g dry weight**

**Clinically evident iron overload of hereditary hemochromatosis exhibit
\>10,000 µg/g dry weight of iron**

**\>22,000 µg/g dry weight are associated with the development of
fibrosis and cirrhosis**

# Wilson Disease

**Autosomal recessive**

**Accumulation of toxic levels of copper**

**Liver, brain, and eye**

**Loss-of-function mutations in the ATP7B gene**

**Chromosome 13, encodes an ATPase metal ion transporter that localizes
to the Golgi region of hepatocytes**

**Normal copper physiology**

**Absorption of ingested copper (2 to 5 mg/day)**

**Plasma transport in complex with albumin**

**Hepatocellular uptake, followed by binding to an α2 -globulin
(apoceruloplasmin) to form ceruloplasmin**

**Secretion of ceruloplasmin-bound copper into plasma, where it accounts
for 90% to 95% of plasma copper**

**Hepatic uptake of desialylated, senescent ceruloplasmin from the
plasma, followed by lysosomal degradation and secretion of free copper
into bile**

- **without ATP7B activity**

  - **copper cannot be passed on to apoceruloplasmin and cannot be
    excreted into bile**

- **Copper accumulates progressively in hepatocytes**

- **Toxic injury by**

- **promoting the formation of free radicals**

- **binding to sulfhydryl groups of cellular proteins**

- **displacing other metals in hepatic metalloenzymes**

- **By the age of 5 years**

  - **Copper begins to escape from the overloaded, damaged hepatocytes
    into the circulation**
  - **Free copper generates oxidants Red cell hemolysis**
  - **Deposited and damage to**
  - **Brain, cornea, kidneys, bones, joints, and parathyroid glands**
  - **Urinary excretion of copper increases markedly**

- **Hepatocellular carcinoma is quite uncommon in Wilson disease**

- **Kayser-Fleischer rings**

![](./img-local/Inflammatory%2C-Toxic%2C-Alcoholic-and-Metabolic-Diseases-of-Liver22.jpg)

- **May mimic other liver diseases**
  - **Fatty liver diseases**
  - **Viral hepatitis**
  - **Acute and chronic hepatitis**
  - **Excess copper deposition can often be demonstrated by special
    stains**
    - **rhodanine stain for copper, orcein stain for copper-associated
      protein**
  - **Hepatic copper content in excess of 250 µg/g dry weight is most
    helpful for making a diagnosis**
- **Basal ganglia, putamen**
  - **Atrophy and even cavitation**
  - **Hepatolenticular degeneration**
- **Kayser-Fleischer rings**
  - **Green to brown deposits of copper in Descemet membrane in the
    limbus of the cornea**

# α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency

**Autosomal recessive disorder**

**Abnormally low serum levels**

**The major function of AAT is the inhibition of proteases**

**Pulmonary emphysema**

**Hepatic disease results from retention of mutant AAT in the liver**

**AAT synthesized predominantly by hepatocytes**

**Most allelic variants produce normal or mildly reduced levels of serum
AAT**

**Homozygotes for the Z allele ( PiZZ genotype) have circulating AAT
levels that are only 10% of normal levels**

**PiMZ heterozygotes have intermediate plasma levels of AAT**

**The PiZ polypeptide contains a single amino acid substitution that
results in misfolding of the nascent polypeptide in the hepatocyte
endoplasmic reticulum**

**Mutant protein cannot be secreted by the hepatocyte, it accumulates in
the endoplasmic reticulum and triggers unfolded protein response, lead
to induction of apoptosis**

**Marked cholestasis with hepatocyte necrosis in newborns**

**Childhood cirrhosis**

**Chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis that becomes apparent only late in
life**

**Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 2% to 3% of adults with PiZZ
genotype, usually but not always in the setting of cirrhosis**

**The treatment and cure for the severe hepatic disease are orthotopic
liver transplantation**

**α1-Antitrypsin deficiency**

**Round to oval cytoplasmic globules composed of retained AAT**

**Glycoprotein stains with PAS**
