# Santral Sinir Sisteminde Hasar

# Dr. Serdar BALCI

# Santral Sinir Sistemi

- **Anatomi önemli**
  - **Belirti, bulgu ve klinik özellikler**
- **Histoloji ve reaksiyon paternleri farklı**
- **Kendine özgü tümör ve hastalıkları var**

# SANTRAL SINIR SISTEMI HASAR PATERNLERI

# Nöron hasarı

- **Geri dönüşsüz hipoksik-iskemik atağın ilk 12 saati:**
  - **Akut sinir hasarı**
    - **Hücredeki değişiklikler (perikaryon)**
    - **Aksonlardaki değişiklikler**
    - **Akson hasarına ikincil perikaryondaki değişiklikler**
  - **Kan-beyin bariyerinin yıkılması**
    - **Serebral ödem**

**Hücrede büzüşme, piknozis, nükleol kaybı, Nissl cisimciği kaybı,
sitoplazmada belirgin eozinofili (kırmızı nöron)**

**Nükleus da büzüşen hücre gibi köşeli şekil alır**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Injured axons undergo swelling and show disruption of axonal
transport**

**Swellings (spheroids) can be recognized on H&E stains and can be
highlighted by silver staining or immunohistochemistry.**

**Axonal spheroids are visible as bulbous swellings at points of
disruption, or altered axonal transport.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Axonal injury**

**-leads to cell body enlargement and rounding**

**-peripheral displacement of the nucleus**

**-enlargement of the nucleolus**

**-peripheral dispersion of Nissl substance (central chromatolysis)**

**C: With axonal injury there can be swelling of the cell body and
peripheral dispersal of the Nissl substance, termed chromatolysis.**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Other diseases also cause changes in neurons

- **Specific intracellular inclusions**
  - **Neurodegenerative diseases**
    - **Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease**
    - **Tangles in Alzheimer disease**
  - **Pathogenic viruses**
- **Neuronal processes**
  - **thickened and tortuous In some neurodegenerative diseases**
  - **dystrophic neurites**
- **Age**
  - **cytoplasm and lysosomes**
  - **accumulate complex lipids (lipofuscin)**

# Astrocytes in Injury and Repair

- **Principal cells responsible for repair and scar formation in the
  brain**
- **Gliosis**
- **Astrocytes undergo both hypertrophy and hyperplasia**
- **Nucleus enlarges and becomes vesicular**
- **Nucleolus becomes prominent**
- **Gemistocytic astrocyte**
  - **Previously scant cytoplasm expands and takes on a bright pink hue,
    and the cell extends multiple stout, ramifying processes**

**Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease**

# Fibroblasts

**Participate in healing after brain injury to a limited extent**

**Except in penetrating brain trauma or around abscesses**

# Fibrillary astrocytes

**Long-standing gliosis**

**Cytoplasm of reactive astrocytes shrinks in size**

**Cellular processes become more tightly interwoven**

# Rosenthal fibers

**Thick, elongated, brightly eosinophilic protein aggregates found in
astrocytic processes in chronic gliosis and in some low-grade gliomas**

# Oligodendrocytes

- **Produce myelin**
- **Limited spectrum of specific morphologic changes in response to
  various injuries**
- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**
  - **viral inclusions**
  - **smudgy, homogeneous-appearing enlarged nucleus**

# Microglial cells

**Bone-marrow–derived cells**

**Function as the resident phagocytes of the CNS**

**Activated by tissue injury, infection, or trauma**

**Proliferate and become more prominent histologically**

- **Take on the appearance of activated macrophages**
  - **In areas of demyelination, organizing infarct, or hemorrhage**
- **Rod cells**
  - **Neurosyphilis or other infections, they develop elongated nuclei**
- **Microglial nodules**
  - **Aggregates of elongated microglial cells at sites of tissue
    injury**
- **Neuronophagia**
  - **Collections congregating around and phagocytosing injured
    neurons**

# Ependymal cells

- **Cytomegalovirus**
  - **can produce extensive ependymal injury**
  - **typical viral inclusions**
