# EMPHYSEMA

# Emphysema

**Abnormal permanent enlargement of the air spaces distal to the
terminal bronchioles**

**Destruction of alveoli walls without significant fibrosis**

# Types of Emphysema

- **Clinically significant airway obstruction**
- **Centriacinar emphysema**
  - **20x more common**
  - **95% of clinically significant cases**

**Centriacinar**

**Panacinar**

**Distal acinar**

**Irregular**

**Centriacinar emphysema: Central areas show marked emphysematous
damage, surrounded by relatively spared alveolar spaces**

# Centriacinar (Centrilobular) Emphysema

**Central, proximal parts of the acini**

**Respiratory bronchioles are affected**

**Distal alveoli are spared**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases9.png)

**Both emphysematous and normal air spaces exist within the same acinus
and lobule**

- **More common and severe in the upper lobes, apical segments**
- **In severe cases distal acinus also involved**
  - **Differentiation from panacinar emphysema becomes difficult**

**Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases12.png)

**Panacinar emphysema: involving the entire pulmonary lobule**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases13.png)

# Panacinar (Panlobular) Emphysema

- **Acini are uniformly enlarged**
  - **From respiratory bronchiole to terminal blind alveoli**
- **More commonly in the lower lung zones, anterior margins**
- **Associated with**
  - **α1-antitrypsin deficiency**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases14.png)

# Distal Acinar (Paraseptal) Emphysema

**Proximal portion is normal**

**Distal part is primarily involved**

**More striking adjacent to the pleura, along the lobular connective
tissue septa, and at the margins of the lobules**

**Occurs adjacent to areas of fibrosis, scarring, or atelectasis**

**More severe in the upper half of the lungs**

**Multiple, contiguous, enlarged air spaces**

**0.5 mm - \>2.0 cm**

**Cystic structures**

**Progressive enlargement**

**Bullae**

**Cause is unknown**

**Most often in spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults**

# Irregular Emphysema

- **Acinus is irregularly involved**
- **Associated with scarring**
- **Healed inflammatory diseases**
- **Clinically asymptomatic**
  - **Most common form of emphysema**

# Pathogenesis of Emphysema

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases17.png)

- **Exposure to toxic substances**
  - **Tobacco smoke, inhaled pollutants**
  - **Ongoing inflammation**
  - **Accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes**
  - **Elastases, cytokines (IL-8), oxidants are released**
  - **Epithelial injury and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix**

# Emphysema

**Elastin degradation products increase the inflammation**

**80% of patients with congenital α1-antitrypsin (antielastase)
deficiency develop symptomatic panacinar emphysema**

**Earlier age and with greater severity if the affected person smokes**

**TGFB gene polymorphisms influence susceptibility to COPD**

**MMP-9 and MMP-12**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Emphysema**

**Fibrosing lung diseases**

- **Tissue destruction without fibrosis**
- **Loss of epithelial and endothelial cells**
- **Also loss of mesenchymal cells**
  - **Lack of extracellular matrix**
  - **Emphysema can be thought as an insufficient wound repair**
- **Tissue destruction with interstitial fibrosis **
  - **Excessive myofibroblastic or fibroblastic response to injury**
  - **Scarring**

# Airway obstruction in emphysema

- **Normally: Small airways are held open bu the elastic recoil of
  parenchyma**
- **Emphysema:**
  - **Loss of elastic tissue**
  - **During respiration respiratory bronchioles collapse**
  - **Functional airway obstruction occurs, despite there is no
    mechanical obstruction**
  - **There is also narrowing of lumen due to ongoing chronic
    inflammatory changes**

# Macroscopic appearance

- **Panacinar emphysema**
  - **Pale, voluminous lungs**
  - **Obscure the heart when the anterior chest wall is removed at
    autopsy**
- **Centriacinar emphysema **
  - **Upper two thirds of the lungs are more severely affected than the
    lower lungs**

# Histologic examination

- **Destruction of alveolar walls without fibrosis, leading to enlarged
  air spaces**
- **Alveolar loss**
- **The number of alveolar capillaries is diminished**
- **Terminal and respiratory bronchioles deformed**
  - **Loss of septa**
  - **Collapse during expiration**
- **Bronchiolar inflammation and submucosal fibrosis in advanced
  disease**

# Conditions Related to Emphysema

- **Compensatory emphysema**
  - **Response to loss of lung substance**
  - **Surgical removal of a diseased lung or lobe**
- **Obstructive overinflation**
  - **Lung expands because air is trapped within it**
  - **Tumor or foreign object**
- **Bullous emphysema**
  - **Any form of emphysema produces large subpleural blebs or bullae**
  - **Greater than 1 cm in diameter in the distended state**
  - **May rupture, leading to pneumothorax**

**Autopsy Pathology: A Manual and Atlas**

- **Mediastinal (interstitial) emphysema**
  - **Air enters the connective tissue stroma of the lung, mediastinum,
    and subcutaneous tissue**
  - **Spontaneously with a sudden increase in intra-alveolar pressure →
    tear → air enters into tissue**
    - **vomiting or violent coughing**
    - **children with whooping cough**
    - **patients on respirators who have partial bronchiolar
      obstruction**
    - **perforating injury**

**Interstitial pulmonary emphysema**

# CHRONIC BRONCHITIS

# Chronic Bronchitis

**Clinical definition: Persistant cough with sputum, at least 3 months,
at least 2 consecutive years, absence of any identifiable cause**

**Cigarette smokers**

**Urban, smog-ridden cities**

**20-25% of men in 40-65-year-old age have the disease**

- **Hypersecretion of mucus**
  - **Beginning in the large airways**
- **Hypertrophy of mucous glands in the trachea and main bronchi**
- **Increase in mucin-secreting goblet cells in the surface epithelium
  of smaller bronchi and bronchioles**
- **Inflammation with infiltration of CD8+ lymphocytes, macrophages, and
  neutrophils**
  - **No eosinophils in contrast to asthma **
- **Mucus hypersecretion is primarily a reflection of large bronchial
  involvement**
- **Morphologic basis of airflow obstruction in chronic bronchitis is
  more peripheral:**
- **Small airway disease**
  - **Goblet cell metaplasia**
  - **Mucous plugging of the bronchiolar lumen**
  - **Inflammation, and bronchiolar wall fibrosis**
- **Coexistent emphysema**
  - **Chronic bronchiolitis**
  - **Almost always complicated by emphysema**
- **Effects of environmental irritants**
  - **T cell cytokines --\> IL-13**
  - **Transcription of the mucin gene MUC5AC in bronchial epithelium**
  - **Production of neutrophil elastase**
- **Microbial infection has a secondary role**

**Chronic bronchitis: Marked thickening of the mucous gland layer
(approximately twice-normal) and squamous metaplasia of lung
epithelium**

![](./img-local/Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Diseases23.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Mucosal lining of the larger airways**

  - **hyperemic and swollen by edema fluid**
  - **covered by a layer of mucinous or mucopurulent secretions**

- **Smaller bronchi and bronchioles**

  - **filled with similar secretions**

- **The diagnostic feature of chronic bronchitis in the trachea and
  larger bronchi → enlargement of the mucus-secreting glands**

  - **Reid index increased**
    - **Ratio of the thickness of the submucosal gland layer to that of
      the bronchial wall**
    - **normally 0.4**

- **Inflammatory cells, largely mononuclear, neutrophils**

- **Chronic bronchiolitis**

  - **Small airway disease**
  - **Goblet cell metaplasia**
  - **Mucous plugging, inflammation, and fibrosis**

- **Bronchiolitis obliterans**

  - **Severe cases**
  - **Complete obliteration of the lumen as a consequence of fibrosis **
  - **Submucosal fibrosis leads to luminal narrowing and airway
    obstruction**
  - **Changes of emphysema co-exist**
