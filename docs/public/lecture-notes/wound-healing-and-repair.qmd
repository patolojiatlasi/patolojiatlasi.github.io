# Wound Healing and Repair

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Repair (Healing)

__Restoration of tissue architecture and function after an injury__

__Regeneration of the injured tissue__

__Scar formation by the deposition of connective tissue__

# Regeneration

* __replace the damaged cells__
* __return to a normal state__
* __occurs by__
  * __proliferation of residual \(uninjured\) cells that retain the capacity to divide__
  * __replacement from tissue stem cells __
* __skin and intestines__
  * __rapidly dividing epithelia__
* __liver__

__Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease__

# Scar formation (Nedbeleşme)

__Tissues incapable of regeneration__

__Supporting structures of the tissue are severely damaged__

__Repair occurs by the laying down of connective \(fibrous\) tissue → scar formation__

__Cannot perform the function of lost parenchymal cells__

__Structural stability that the injured tissue is usually able to function__

* __Extensive deposition of collagen__
* __Lungs\, liver\, kidney__
  * __Consequence of chronic inflammation__
* __Myocardium__
  * __Extensive ischemic necrosis \(infarction\)__

# Organization

__Organizing pneumonia__

__Fibrosis develops in a tissue space occupied by an inflammatory exudate__

# Healing of Skin Wounds

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Healing by First Intention

__Clean\, uninfected surgical incision__

__Approximated by surgical sutures__

__Focal disruption of epithelial basement membrane continuity__

__Death of relatively few epithelial and connective tissue cells__

__Epithelial regeneration is the principal mechanism of repair__

__A small scar is formed__

__There is minimal wound contraction__

__Incisional space first fills with fibrin\-clotted blood__

__Rapidly invaded by granulation tissue__

__Covered by new epithelium__

__Within 24 hours__

__Neutrophils are seen at the incision margin\, migrating to fibrin clot__

__Basal cells at the cut edge of the epidermis increased mitotic activity__

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair6.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Within 24 to 48 hours__

__Epithelial cells from both edges have begun to migrate and proliferate along the dermis__

__Deposite basement membrane components as they progress__

__The cells meet in the midline beneath the surface scab__

__A thin but continuous epithelial layer\.__

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair7.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__By day 3__

__Neutrophils replaced by macrophages__

__Granulation tissue progressively invades the incision space__

__Collagen fibers are evident at the incision margins\, but these are vertically oriented and do not bridge the incision__

__Epithelial cell proliferation continues\, yielding a thickened epidermal covering layer__

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair8.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__By day 5__

__Neovascularization reaches its peak__

__Granulation tissue fills the incisional space__

__Collagen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the incision__

__The epidermis recovers its normal thickness__

__Differentiation of surface cells yields a mature epidermal architecture with surface keratinization__

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair9.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__Second week__

__Continued collagen accumulation and fibroblast proliferation__

__The leukocyte infiltrate\, edema\, and increased vascularity are substantially diminished__

__Increasing collagen deposition within the incisional scar__

__Regression of vascular channels__

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair10.png)

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

__By the end of the first month__

__Scar consists of a cellular connective tissue__

__No inflammatory cells__

__Covered by a normal epidermis__

__Dermal appendages destroyed in the line of the incision are permanently lost The tensile strength of the wound increases with time__

__Robbins Basic Pathology__

# Healing by Second Intention

* __When cell or tissue loss is more extensive__
* __Large wounds__
* __Sites of abscess formation__
* __Ulceration__
* __Ischemic necrosis \(infarction\) in parenchymal organs__
* __The repair process is more complex __
  * __involves a combination of regeneration and scarring__

# Healing by Second Intention (secondary union)
