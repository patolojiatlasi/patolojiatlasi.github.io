# PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS

# Primary Lung Tumors

* __95% of primary lung tumors are carcinomas__
* __5% →__
  * __Carcinoids__
  * __Mesenchymal malignancies\, fibrosarcomas\, leiomyomas__
  * __Lymphomas__
  * __Other benign lesions__

# Pulmonary Hamartoma

* __Most common benign tumor__
  * __Spherical__
  * __Small \(3 to 4 cm\)__
  * __Coin lesion on chest radiographs__
  * __Mature cartilage\,  often admixed with fat\, fibrous tissue\, and blood vessels__
  * __Clonal cytogenic abnormalities show that it is a benign neoplasm__
    * __Misnomer as hamartoma__

# Lung cancer

* __Carcinoma of the lung__
* __Single most important cause of cancer\-related deaths in industrialized countries__
  * __Incidence among males is gradually decreasing\, but it continues to increase among females__
  * __Women dying each year from lung cancer than from breast cancers__
  * __Causal relationship of cigarette smoking and lung cancer__
* __Peak incidence in 50s\-60s__
* __>50% of patients already have distant metastatic disease__
  * __1/4 have disease in the regional lymph nodes__
* __5\-yr survival rate for all stages 16%__
  * __Even localized to lung 45%__

# Smoking-related carcinomas

* __Stepwise accumulation of a multitude of genetic abnormalities__
* __Sequence of molecular changes is not random__
  * __Follows a predictable sequence that parallels the histologic progression__
* __Early__
  * __Inactivation of the putative tumor suppressor genes on \(3p\)__
  * __Found in benign bronchial epithelium of persons with lung cancer__
  * __In the respiratory epithelium of smokers without lung cancer__
  * __Field effect __
* __Late__
  * __TP53 mutations or activation of the KRAS oncogene__

# Nonsmoking women of Far Eastern origin

__Activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor \(EGFR\)__

__Sensitive to agents that inhibit EGFR signaling__

# Smoking

__90% of lung cancers occur in active smokers or those who stopped recently__

__Linear correlation has been recognized between the frequency of lung cancer and pack\-years of cigarette smoking__

__60x greater among habitual heavy smokers \(two packs a day for 20 years\) than among nonsmokers__

* __Only 11% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer__
  * __Other predisposing factors must be operative in the pathogenesis of this deadly disease__
* __Mutagenic effect of carcinogens is conditioned by hereditary \(genetic\) factors__
  * __P\-450 monooxygenase enzyme system__

* __Women have a higher susceptibility to carcinogens in tobacco than men__
* __Cessation of smoking decreases the risk of developing lung cancer over time__
  * __May never return to baseline levels__
  * __Genetic changes can persist for many years__

* __Passive smoking__
  * __2x risk than nonsmokers__
* __Pipes and cigars also increases the risk__
* __Miners__
  * __Radioactive ores__
  * __Asbestos workers__
  * __Dusts containing arsenic\, chromium\, uranium\, nickel\, vinyl chloride\, and mustard gas__
* __Exposure to asbestos__
  * __5x risk in nonsmokers__
  * __55x risk in smokers__
