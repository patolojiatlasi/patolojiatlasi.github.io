# Introduction to Pathology

# Serdar BALCI, MD

# Pathology

**Study (logos)**

**Disease (pathos)**

**Literally translated, ** *pathology* \_\_ is the study (\_\_ *logos*
**) of disease (** *pathos,* \_\_ suffering)\_\_

- **Study of changes that underlie in disease**
  - **Organs**
  - **Tissues**
  - **Cells**
  - **Genes**
  - **Proteins, enzymes**
- **Changes**
  - **Structural changes**
  - **Biochemical changes**
  - **Functional changes**
- **These changes give rise to signs and symptoms in a patient**

# Pathology uses

- **Morphologic techniques**
  - **Macroscopy**
  - **Long live the classic friend!: H&E**
- **Molecular techniques**
  - **PCR, ISH, GWAS, Next-gen Seq**
- **Microbiologic techniques**
  - **Various methods to identify microorganisms**
- **Immunologic techniques**
  - **Immunohistochemistry**
- **And autopsy**
  - **A very informative technique nowadays forgotten**

# Pathology tries to explain whys and wherefores

- **What is the morphologic change in the cells, tissues, organs in the
  disease?**
- **Are these morphologic changes constant, reproducible in certain
  disease?**
- **What is the cause of this morphologic change?**
- **What is the subcellular mechanism of this morphologic change?**
  - **Electron microscopy**
- **What proteins are involved in the disease?**
  - **Histochemistry, Immunohistochemistry**
- **What effect do these proteins make on morphology?**
- **What is the genetic change causing the change in proteins?**

**Is there any microorganism around?**

**Is the changes in morphology caused by microbes constant in certain
diseases?**

**What is the main cause of death in a patient or victim?**

**What is the mechanism taken place during the death?**

- **How are signs and symptoms related to diseases?**
- **What is the way to cure a patient?**
- **Does the therapy have a rational base?**
  - **Will the anti tyrosine kinase inhibitor be effective in a
    colorectal cancer patient?**
  - **Does the cancer have K-Ras mutation?**

**Which disease causes how much survival?**

**Are the subgroups of diseases differ in terms of survival?**

# Pathology is the bridge

**The bridge between the basic sciences and clinics**

**The scientific foundation for all of medicine**

**Did you hear about “evidence based medicine”?**

**Then we will send you to the clinics**

**Systemic pathology will be the topic of next year**

**You should know the roots to understand general pathology**

# General Pathology

- **Reactions of cells and tissues to abnormal stimuli and inherited
  defects**
  - **Cellular Responses to Stress and Toxic Insults: Adaptation,
    Injury, and Death**
  - **Acute and Chronic Inflammation**
  - **Tissue Renewal, Regeneration, and Repair**
  - **Hemodynamic Disorders, Thromboembolic Disease, and Shock**
  - **Genetic Disorders**
  - **Diseases of the Immune System**
  - **Neoplasia**
  - **Infectious Diseases**
  - **Environmental and Nutritional Diseases**
  - **Diseases of Infancy and Childhood**

# Systemic pathology

- **Alterations in specialized organs and tissues that are responsible
  for disorders that involve these organs**
  - **Blood Vessels, Heart**
  - **White Blood Cells, Lymph Nodes, Spleen, and Thymus**
  - **Lung, Head and Neck**
  - **Gastrointestinal, Liver and Biliary Tract, Pancreas**
  - **Kidney, Lower Urinary Tract and Male Genital System**
  - **Female Genital Tract, Breast**
  - **Endocrine System**
  - **Skin**
  - **Bones, Joints, Soft-Tissue**
  - **Peripheral and Central Nervous System**

# Types of diseases

- **Genetic**
  - **Developmental**
- **Infectious**
- **Tumoral**
  - **Benign**
  - **Malignant**
- **Try to learn all diseases in this subgroups and in the clinic try to
  answer the questions in these four groups:**
  - **i.e. “Tell us the pathologies of ovary”**

# Studies of Pathology

**Etiology**

**Pathogenesis**

**Molecular and Morphologic Changes**

**Functional Derangements and Clinical Manifestations**

# Etiology (Why disease arise?)

**Origin of a disease**

**Underlying causes and modifying factors**

# Etiology or Cause

- **Genetic**
  - **Inherited mutations**
  - **Disease-associated gene variants**
  - **Polymorphisms **
- **Acquired (one occurred after)**
  - **Infectious**
  - **Nutritional**
  - **Chemical**
  - **Physical**

# Causes and Risk Factors

**Alterations in Rb protein function leads to cervical cancer**

**HPV is the cause of alterations in Rb function**

**Smoking is the risk factor for cervical cancer**

# One etiology for one disease?

- **Yes, Some genetic and infectious diseases**
- **No, in general.**
  - **We are in a multi-factorial world**
  - **Atherosclerosis**
  - **Cancer**

**Genetic background (susceptibility) + environmental effects**

# Pathogenesis (How disease arise?)

**Steps in the development of disease**

**How etiologic factors trigger cellular and molecular changes**

**How these changes give rise to the specific functional and structural
abnormalities**

# Pathogenesis

**How the disease forms in sequence**

# Molecular and Morphologic Changes

- **Structural alterations**
  - **in tissues**
    - **macroscopy**
  - **in cells**
    - **under microscope**
    - **H&E or Electron microscopy**
- **Characteristic of a disease**
- **Diagnostic of an etiologic process**

# Functional Derangements and Clinical Manifestations

**Genetic**

**Biochemical**

**Structural changes**

**Functional abnormalities**

**Clinical features**

**Course**

**Outcome**

# Pathology also deals with Epidemiology

**Especially in Cancer Registry**

**SEER, Globocan, ICD, SNOMED … **

**The founder of modern pathology Dr.Virchow was an active politican in
Berlin and dealt with public health**

# Diagnostic Pathology

- **Studies nature and progression of disease**
- **Morphologic changes**

  - **Microscopic**
- **Chemical alterations**
- **Immunologic properties**
- **Molecular alterations**
