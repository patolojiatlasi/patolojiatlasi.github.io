# Homeostasis

- **A happy normal cell**
  - **Comfortable**
    - **Suitable environment for function and differentiation**
  - **Neighbours and neighbourhood**
    - **Interaction with other cells**
  - **Good income**
    - **Available metabolic substrates**
  - **Can deal with daily problems**
    - **Physiologic demands**
  - **No enemy**
- **A normal cardiac cell**
  - **Comfortable**
    - **Suitable environment for contraction**
  - **Neighbours**
    - **Can interact with vascular supply, nerves and other cells**
  - **Good income**
    - **Oxygen and glucose is readily available**
  - **Can deal with daily problems**
    - **Can pump faster if necessary**
  - **No enemy**
    - **No organisms (Toxoplasmosis), or autoimmune activity**

# Adaptations

**Reversible**

**Functional and structural responses**

**More severe physiologic stresses**

**Pathologic stimuli**

**A new steady state is achieved. **

**Continue to function**

# Type of adaptations

- **Hypertrophy**
  - **Increase in size of the cells**
  - **Increase in proteins, increase in function**
- **Hyperplasia**
  - **Increase in number of cells**
- **Atrophy**
  - **Decrease in size and metabolic activity of the cell**
- **Metaplasia**
  - **Change in cell phenotype**

# If cell cannot adapt

**If adaptive capability is exceeded**

**Or the stress is very harmfull**

**If stress is severe**

**Persistent**

**Rapid onset**

**Irreversible Injury**

# Cell Death

- **Many causes**
  - **ischemia (lack of blood flow)**
  - **Infections**
  - **Toxins**
  - **Immune reactions**
- **It is also a “normal” process**
  - **Remember embriology?**
  - **GIS epitheium regenerates every week**

# Cardiac muscle cells

**Increased demand **

**to pump more and MORE**

**Decrease O** **2** \_\_ supply\_\_

**Increased demand **

**to pump more**

![](./img-local/General-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Injury1.jpg)

**Atherosclerosis**

**ischemia**

**Muscle adapts**

**Increases functional units (proteins)**

**Adapts→hypertrophy**

**Cell cannot aford the demand**

**Ischemia**

**Cell death**

![](./img-local/General-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Injury2.jpg)

**Remember!**

**Adaptation is good. But for a certain time.**

**Adapted cell is functioning, but not as good as it used to be.**

**Adapted cell is more vulnerable to injury.**

# Adaptations

- **Physiologic**
  - **normal stimulation by hormones or endogenous chemical mediators**
  - **the hormone-induced enlargement of the breast and uterus during
    pregnancy**
- **Pathologic**
  - **responses to stress**
  - **Escape from injury**

# CELL INJURY AND CELL DEATH

# Cell injury

**Occurs;**

**So severe stress → unable to adapt**

**Exposed to inherently damaging agents, intrinsic anomalies**

# Reversible cell injury

**Early, mild forms**

**Reversible when damage is removed**

**No severe membrane damage**

**No nuclear dissolution**

# Cell death

- **Irreversible;**
- **Necrosis**
  - **Cell killed by external factor/cells**
- **Apoptosis**
  - **Cell kills itself**

# Necrosis

- **Damage to membranes is severe:**

  - **enzymes leak out of lysosomes**
  - **enter the cytoplasm,**
  - **digest the cell**
  - **necrosis.**

- **Cellular contents leak into the extracellular space**

- **host reaction (inflammation)**

- **always a pathologic process**

- **reasons:**

  - **ischemia,**
  - **exposure to toxins**
  - **various infections**
  - **trauma**

# Apoptosis

**nuclear dissolution**

**without complete loss of membrane integrity. **

**Reasons:**

**deprivation of growth factors**

**DNA or proteins are damaged beyond repair**

**many normal functions and is not necessarily associated with
pathologic cell injury**

**no inflammatory response**
