# APOPTOSIS

# Apoptosis (falling off)

**A pathway of cell death**

**Cells activate enzymes **

**The enzymes degrade the cells’ own nuclear DNA and nuclear and
cytoplasmic proteins**

**Fragments break off the cell**

# Apoptosis

- **Plasma membrane stays intact**
- **There are “signals” on the surface of membranes, attracting
  phagocytes**
- **Cellular content does not leak out**
  - **There is no inflammatory response**

# Apoptosis Early stage

# Pathologic Causes of Apoptosis

**When cell DNA changes beyond repair**

**It is a controlled death to avoid further damage in the
cell/tissue/organism**

# Pathologic Causes of ApoptosisDNA damage

- *Radiation, cytotoxic anticancer drugs, extremes of temperature,
  hypoxia*
  - *If mild ends into apoptosis*
  - *If severe necrosis*
- **DNA damage occurs directly or via free radicals**
- **To prevent malignant transformation cell goes to apoptosis**
- **Some antineoplastic agents cause DNA damage to force neoplastic
  cells into apoptosis**

# Pathologic Causes of ApoptosisMisfolded proteins

**Misfolded proteins accumulate in ER**

**Induces apoptosis**

# Pathologic Causes of ApoptosisViruses

**Adenovirus and HIV induces cell death**

# The Mitochondrial (Intrinsic) Pathway of Apoptosis

- **Responds to stimuli**
- **growth factors (or their withdrawal)**
- **biochemical stress**
- **DNA damage**
  - **due to radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy **

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy19.png)

- **Bcl-2**
  - **Anti-apoptotic**
  - **inhibit many factors that induce apoptosis**
- **Bax**
  - **Pro-apoptotic**
  - **forms Bax–Bax dimers which enhance apoptotic stimuli**
- **The ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax**
  - **determines whether a cell goes to apoptosis**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy20.png)

- **p53 is a multifunctional protein**
  - **induces cell cycle arrest and initiates DNA damage repair**
  - **if this is unsuccessful, p53 can induce apoptosis**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy21.png)

**Mitochondria contain several proteins that are capable of inducing
apoptosis**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy22.png)

# The Death Receptor (Extrinsic) Pathway of Apoptosis

- **Ligand-binding**
- **Death receptors on the cell surface**
- **Tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) gene family**
  - **TNFR1 and Fas (CD95)**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy23.png)

**Ligand binding**

**clustering of receptor molecules on the cell surface**

**initiation of a signal transduction cascade**

**activation of caspases**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy24.png)

**Fas ligand expressed mainly on activated T lymphocytes**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy25.png)

**A caspase antagonist FLIP, block activation of caspases downstream of
death receptors**

**Some viruses produce homologues of FLIP to keep infected cells alive**

# Activation and Function of Caspases

- **Mitochondrial and death receptor pathways**
- **Activation of the initiator caspases**
  - **caspase-9 and -8**
- **Active forms of these enzymes are produced**
- **These cleave and thereby activate executioner caspases**
- **These cleave numerous targets**
- **Nucleases degrade DNA and nucleoproteins**
- **Caspases also degrade nuclear matrix and cytoskeleton**
- **Fragmentation of cells.**

# Clearance of Apoptotic Cells

- **“Eat me” signals on apoptotic bodies**
  - **Normal cell membrane: phosphatidylserine is present on the inner
    leaflet**
  - **Apoptotic body: this phospholipid flips to outer surface**
  - **apoptotic bodies express adhesive glycoproteins that are
    recognized by phagocytes**
- **Tissue macrophages, phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells**

**No membrane damage**

**The content does not leak out**

**No inflammation is present**

# Apoptosis and Necrosis may occur together

- **DNA damage **
  - **activates poly-ADP(ribose) polymerase**
  - **depletes cellular supplies of NAD**
  - **fall in ATP levels**
  - **necrosis**
- **In ischemia**
  - **Early cell death is apoptosis**
  - **Necrosis later as ischemia worsens**

# EXAMPLES OF APOPTOSIS

# Growth Factor Deprivation

- **Hormone-sensitive cells (hormones)**
- **Lymphocytes (antigens and cytokines)**
- **Neurons (nerve growth factor)**
- **Apoptosis is via the mitochondrial pathway**
  - **Activation of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family**
  - **Decreased synthesis of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL**

# DNA Damage

- **Radiation, chemotherapeutic agents → DNA damage**
- **p53 protein accumulates in cells**
  - **It arrests cell cycle at the G1 phase to allow the DNA to be
    repaired**
  - **If the damage is too great to be repaired successfully, p53
    triggers apoptosis**
    - **activate Bax and Bak**
    - **increasing the synthesis of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2
      family**
- **When p53 is mutated or absent (as in some cancers)**
  - **Cells with damaged DNA survive and replicate**
  - **mutations accumulate**
  - **neoplastic transformation occur**

# Accumulation of Misfolded ProteinsER Stress

- **Normal protein synthesis**
  - **chaperones in the ER control the proper folding of newly
    synthesized proteins**
  - **misfolded polypeptides are ubiquitinated and targeted for
    proteolysis**
- **When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER**
  - **inherited mutations**
  - **environmental perturbations**
- **Unfolded protein response**
  - **activates signaling pathways**
  - **increase the production of chaperones and retard protein
    translation**
  - **reduce the levels of misfolded proteins in the cell**
- **When more misfolded proteins accumulate**
  - **ER stress**
  - **activation of caspases**
  - **apoptosis**

# Apoptosis of Self-Reactive Lymphocytes

- **Lymphocytes recognizing self antigens are normally produced in all
  individuals **
- **When these lymphocytes meet with self antigens, the cells die by
  apoptosis**
  - **Both the mitochondrial pathway and the Fas death receptor
    pathway**
- **Failure of apoptosis of self-reactive lymphocytes is one of the
  causes of autoimmune diseases.**

# Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte–Mediated Apoptosis

- **CTLs recognize foreign antigens presented on the surface of infected
  host cells and tumor cells**
  - **Granzymes enter the target cells**
  - **Granzymes activate cellular caspases**
  - **Kills target cells by directly inducing the effector phase of
    apoptosis, without engaging mitochondria or death receptors**
- **CTLs also express FasL on their surface and may kill target cells by
  ligation of Fas receptors**

# NECROPTOSIS

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy29.png)

# Necroptosis

**Shares aspects of both necrosis and apoptosis**

- **Morphologically resembles necrosis**
  - **loss of ATP**
  - **swelling of the cell and organelles**
  - **generation of ROS**
  - **release of lysosomal enzymes**
  - **rupture of the plasma membrane**
- **Mechanistically resembles programmed cell death**
- **Triggered by genetically programmed signal transduction events**
  - **Programmed necrosis**
- **Different from necrosis driven passively by toxic or anoxic injury
  to the cell**
- **No caspase activation**
  - **“caspase-independent” programmed cell death**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy30.png)

**Triggered by ligation of TNFR1, and viral proteins of RNA and DNA
viruses**

**caspase-independent but dependent on signaling by the RIP1 and RIP3
complex**

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy31.png)

**RIP1-RIP3 signaling reduces mitochondrial ATP generation**

**Production of ROS**

**Permeabilizes lysosomal membranes**

**Cellular swelling and membrane damage**

**Release of cellular contents evokes an inflammatory reaction as in
necrosis**

- **Physiologic:**
  - **During the formation of the mammalian bone growth plate**
- **Pathologic**
  - **Steatohepatitis**
  - **Acute pancreatitis**
  - **Reperfusion injury**
  - **Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease**
- **Backup mechanism in host defense**
  - **Against certain viruses that encode caspase inhibitors
    (cytomegalovirus)**

# Pyroptosis

- **Occurs in cells infected by microbes**
- **Activation of caspase-1**
- **Cleaves the precursor form of IL-1 to generate biologically active
  IL-1**
- **Caspase-1 along with closely related caspase-11 cause death of the
  infected cell**
- **Pyro: fever**
  - **Fever inducing cytokine IL-1**

# AUTOPHAGY

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy33.png)

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy34.png)

# Autophagy: self-eating

- **Lysosomal digestion of the cell’s own components**
- **A survival mechanism in times of nutrient deprivation**
  - **recycling to provide nutrients and energy**
- **autophagy genes.” Autophagy has been proposed as a form of cell
  death in different diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and
  degenerative diseases of muscle. **

![](./img-local/The-Mechanisms-of-Cell-Death-apoptosis-autophagy35.png)

**Intracellular organelles and portions of cytosol are sequestered
within an autophagic vacuole**

**The vacuole fuses with lysosomes to form an autophagolysosome**

**Lysosomal enzymes digest the cellular components. **

**Autophagy may also signal cell death by apoptosis.**
