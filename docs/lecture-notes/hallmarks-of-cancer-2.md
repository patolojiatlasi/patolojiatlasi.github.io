# EVASION OF CELL DEATH

**Resistance to Apoptosis**

![](img%5CHallmarks-of-Cancer-22.png)

# Extrinsic Pathway

**TNF receptor CD95 (Fas) binds to ligand CD95L**

**Trimerization of the receptor and cytoplasmic death domains**

**Attract the intracellular adaptor protein FADD**

**Procaspase-8 activated by cleavage into smaller subunits**

**Caspase-8 activates downstream caspase-3**

**Cleaves DNA and other substrates**

**Cell death**

# Intrinsic Pathway

**Withdrawal of survival factors, stress, and injury**

**Permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane**

**Cytochrome c leaks into the cytosol**

**Binds to APAF-1**

**Activates caspase-9**

**Cleave and activate the executioner caspases**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

- **Pro-apoptotic proteins**
  - **BAX and BAK**
  - **Directly promote mitochondrial permeabilization**
- **Anti-apoptotic proteins**
  - **BCL2 and BCL-XL**
  - **inhibit BAX and BAK**
- **BH3-only proteins**
  - **BAD, BID, and PUMA**
  - **Regulate the balance between the pro- and anti-apoptotic
    proteins**

# Follicular B cell Lymphoma

- **t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation**
- **14q32**
  - **chromosomal locus for Ig heavy-chain genes**
  - **Transcriptionally active**
- **18q21**
  - **BCL2**
- **When they come together**
  - **Overexpression of the BCL2 protein**
- **B cells are protected from apoptosis**
- **They are indolent tumors**
  - **Since the change is not actively proliferating cells but
    preventing from death**

# Autophagy

**Stress may also induce cells to consume their components**

**Cancer cells may accumulate mutations to avoid autophagy**

**Cancer cells use autophagy to survive in unfriendly climates or during
therapy**

# LIMITLESS REPLICATIVE POTENTIAL

# Telomer Shortening in normal human cells

![](img%5CHallmarks-of-Cancer-26.png)

**Capacity of 60 to 70 doublings**

**Shortening of telomeres**

**Recognized by the DNA repair machinery as double-stranded DNA breaks**

**Then enter senescence**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Telomer shortening in neoplasia

![](img%5CHallmarks-of-Cancer-27.png)

**TP53 or RB mutations, cell is forced to replicate**

**Nonhomologous end-joining pathway is activated**

**Joining the shortened ends of two chromosomes.**

**Dicentric chromosomes**

**Pulled apart at anaphase**

**Resulting in new double-stranded DNA breaks**

**Genomic instability due to repeated bridge–fusion–breakage cycles**

**Apoptosis may occur**

- **Telomere maintenance is seen in virtually all types of cancers**
- **Upregulation of the enzyme telomerase**
- **Colon tumors**
  - **Early lesions have high genomic instability, low telomerase**
  - **Malignant cells have complex karyotype, high telomerase**

# DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINED ANGIOGENESIS

# Tumor Vessels

- **Tumors cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter unless they are
  vascularized**
- **Cancer cells and large benign tumors can stimulate neoangiogenesis**
  - **New vessels sprout from previously existing capillaries**
- **Vasculogenesis**
  - **Endothelial cells are recruited from the bone marrow**
- **Tumor vasculature is abnormal**
  - **Vessels are leaky and dilated**
  - **Haphazard pattern of connection**

# Effects of vascularization on tumor

- **Supplies needed nutrients and oxygen**
- **Newly formed endothelial cells stimulate the growth of adjacent
  tumor cells**
  - **Secrete growth factors insulin-like growth factors, PDGF, and
    granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor**
- **Required for continued tumor growth**
- **Necessary for metastasis**

# Factors in Angiogenesis

- **Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)**
  - **Angiogenesis inducer**
- **Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)**
  - **Angiogenesis inhibitor**
- **Normal p53 induces synthesis of TSP-1**
- **Production of angiogenic factors and/or loss of angiogenesis
  inhibitors**
  - **Directly by the tumor cells themselves**
  - **Inflammatory cells (macrophages)**
  - **Other stromal cells associated with the tumors**

# Production of Factors in Angiogenesis

- **Proteases**
  - **elaborated by the tumor cells directly or from stromal cells**
  - **regulate the balance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic
    factors**
- **Angiogenic basic FGF stored in the extracellular matrix (ECM)**
  - **Released by proteases**
- **Angiogenesis inhibitors—angiostatin, endostatin, and
  vasculostatin—are produced by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen,
  collagen, and transthyretin, respectively**
- **TSP-1 is produced by stromal fibroblasts themselves in response to
  signals from the tumor cells**

# Normoxia

**HIF-1α activates transcription of VEGF**

**HIF-1α is continuously produced**

**von Hippel–Lindau protein (VHL) binds to HIF-1α**

**Ubiquitination **

**Destruction of HIF-1α**

**No VEGF production in normal oxygen levels**

# Hypoxia

**Tumor that has reached a critical size**

**Lack of oxygen prevents HIF-1α recognition by VHL**

**HIF-1α is not destroyed**

**HIF-1α translocates to the nucleus**

**Activates transcription of its target genes, such as VEGF**

**Angiogenesis occurs**

**Anti-VEGF antibody used in the treatment**

# von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome

- **VHL acts as a tumor suppressor gene**
- **Germline mutations of the VHL gene**
  - **Hereditary renal cell cancers**
  - **Pheochromocytomas**
  - **Hemangiomas of the central nervous system**
  - **Retinal angiomas**
  - **Renal cysts**
