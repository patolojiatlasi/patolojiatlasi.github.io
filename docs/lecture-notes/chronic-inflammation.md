# Chronic Inflammation

- **inflammation of prolonged duration (weeks to years)**
- **continuing inflammation**
- **tissue injury**
- **healing**
  - **often by fibrosis**

**proceed simultaneously**

- **Infiltration with mononuclear cells**
  - **macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells**
- **Tissue destruction**
  - **induced by the products of the inflammatory cells**
- **Repair**
  - **new vessel proliferation (angiogenesis) and fibrosis**

# Chronic inflammation may arise:1) From acute inflammation

- **acute response cannot be resolved**
  - **persistence of the injurious agent**
  - **interference with the normal process of healing**

# Chronic inflammation may arise:2) Persistent infections by microbes that are difficult to eradicate

**Mycobacterium tuberculosis**

**Treponema pallidum**

**syphilis**

**certain viruses and fungi**

**tend to establish persistent infections**

**T lymphocyte–mediated immune response**

**delayed-type hypersensitivity**

# Chronic inflammation may arise:3) Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (hypersensitivity diseases)

- **excessive and inappropriate activation of the immune system**
- **Autoimmune Diseases**
  - **rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis**
- **Allergic Diseases**
  - **bronchial asthma**

# Chronic inflammation may arise:4) Prolonged exposure to potentially toxic agents

**nondegradable exogenous materials**

**inhaled particulate silica**

**endogenous agents**

**cholesterol crystals, atherosclerosis**

# Are these chronic inflammatory diseases?We do not know the definite answer, yetJury is still out

- **Neurodegenerative disorders**
  - **Alzheimer disease**
- **Atherosclerosis**
- **Metabolic syndrome**
- **Type 2 diabetes**
- **Some forms of cancer**

# Mixed acute and chronic inflammation can be observed in immune mediated diseases

**repeated acute phases**

**exacerbation of underlying chronic inflammation**

# Many forms of chronic inflammation may continue to show extensive neutrophilic infiltrates

- **persistent microbes or necrotic cells**
- **mediators elaborated by macrophages. **
- **Such inflammatory lesions are designated as follows:**
  - **“acute on chronic” osteomyelitis**
  - **Active chronic gastritis**

# Macrophages

**the dominant cells of chronic inflammation**

**derived from circulating blood monocytes after their emigration from
the bloodstream**

**normally diffusely scattered in most connective tissues and organs **

**Liver → Kupffer cells**

**spleen and lymph nodes sinus → histiocytes**

**central nervous system → microglial cells**

**lungs → alveolar macrophages**

**mononuclear phagocyte system**

**reticuloendothelial system**

**adhesion molecules and chemokines**

**Migrate within 24 to 48 hours after the onset of acute inflammation**

**transformation into macrophages**

**larger**

**longer lifespan**

**greater capacity for phagocytosis**

**circulate in the blood for only about a day**

# Macrophage Activation

![](./img-local/Chronic-Inflammation19.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Classical macrophage activation

![](./img-local/Chronic-Inflammation20.png)

- **induced by microbial products**
  - **endotoxin**
- **T cell–derived signals**
  - **cytokine IFN-γ**
- **foreign substances**
  - **crystals, particulate matter**
- **produce lysosomal enzymes, NO, and ROS**
  - **enhance their ability to kill ingested organisms**
  - **secrete cytokines**
  - **stimulate inflammation**

# Alternative macrophage activation

![](./img-local/Chronic-Inflammation21.png)

- **induced by IL-4 and IL-13**
  - **produced by T lymphocytes, mast cells and eosinophils**
- **not actively microbicidal**
- **principal role is in tissue repair**
- **secrete growth factors**
  - **angiogenesis**
  - **activate fibroblasts**
  - **stimulate collagen synthesis**

**Robbins and Cotran’s Pathological Basis of Diseases**

# Macrophages

- **central to the initiation and propagation of all inflammatory
  reactions**
- **like neutrophils, ingest and eliminate microbes and dead tissues**
- **initiate the process of tissue repair**
  - **involved in scar formation and fibrosis**
- **secrete mediators of inflammation**
  - **cytokines (TNF, IL-1, chemokines)**
  - **eicosanoids**
- **most important phagocytes in the T cell-mediated arm of adaptive
  immune responses**
  - **display antigens to T lymphocytes**
  - **respond to signals from T cells**

# After inflammation

**the initiating stimulus is eliminated**

**macrophages die**

**go into lymphatics**

**In chronic inflammatory sites**

**macrophage accumulation persists**

**continued recruitment from the blood and local proliferation**

**IFN-γ induce macrophages to fuse into large, multinucleate giant
cells**

**Robbins and Cotran’s Pathological Basis of Diseases**

# Activated B lymphocytes and antibody-producing plasma cells

- **Often present at sites of chronic inflammation**
- **Antibodies against**
  - **persistent foreign antigen**
  - **self antigens in the inflammatory site or against altered tissue
    components**

# Eosinophils

- **Found in **
  - **around parasitic infections**
  - **immune reactions mediated by IgE, allergies**
- **Driven by**
  - **adhesion molecules similar to neutrophils**
  - **specific chemokines (eotaxin) derived from leukocytes and
    epithelial cells**
- **Eosinophil granules contain major basic protein**
  - **highly charged cationic protein**
  - **toxic to parasites**
  - **also causes epithelial cell necrosis**

**Robbins and Cotran’s Pathological Basis of Diseases**

# Mast cells

- **sentinel cells**
- **widely distributed in connective tissues throughout the body**
- **participate in both acute and chronic inflammatory responses**
- **Atopic persons (prone to allergic reactions)**
  - **have IgE antibody on surface specific for certain environmental
    antigens**
  - **when these antigens are encountered, mast cells release histamines
    and AA metabolites**
  - **early vascular changes of acute inflammation**
  - **allergic reactions**
    - **anaphylactic shock**

# Granulomatous inflammation

- **characterized by**
- **aggregates of activated macrophages**
- **scattered lymphocytes**
- **1) persistent T-cell responses to certain microbes**
  - **Mycobacterium tuberculosis, T. pallidum, fungi**
  - **cytokines are responsible for chronic macrophage activation**

# Systemic effects of inflammationacute-phase reaction

**mediated by the cytokines TNF, IL-1, and IL-6**

# Fever, elevation of body temperature

- **pyrogens stimulate prostaglandin synthesis in the vascular and
  perivascular cells of the hypothalamus**
- **Bacterial products, lipopolysaccharide (exogenous pyrogens)**
  - **stimulate leukocytes**
  - **release cytokines (IL-1, TNF endogenous pyrogens)**
  - **increase the levels of cyclooxygenases**
  - **convert AA into prostaglandins**
  - **PGE 2 act on hypothalamus**
  - **stimulate the production of neurotransmitters**
  - **reset the temperature set point at a higher level**
- **NSAIDs (aspirin), reduce fever by inhibiting cyclooxygenase**

# Elevated plasma levels of acute-phase proteins

**Mostly synthesized in the liver, stimulated by cytokines (IL-6)**

**In acute inflammation, concentrations increase several hundred-fold**

**C-reactive protein (CRP)**

**Fibrinogen**

**Serum amyloid A (SAA) protein**

# Acute-phase proteins

- **CRP and SAA**
  - **bind to microbial cell walls**
  - **act as opsonins**
  - **fix complement**
  - **promote the elimination of the microbes**
- **Fibrinogen**
  - **binds to erythrocytes**
  - **form stacks (rouleaux)**
  - **sediment more rapidly at unit gravity than individual
    erythrocytes**
  - **erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)**
- **Serial measurements of ESR and CRP are used to assess therapeutic
  responses in patients with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid
  arthritis**

# Leukocytosis

- **initially because of accelerated release of cells from the bone
  marrow**
  - **influence of cytokines, TNF and IL-1**
  - **Both mature and immature neutrophils may be seen in the blood**
  - **shift to the left**
- **Prolonged infection**
  - **stimulates production of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)**
  - **increase the bone marrow output of leukocytes**
  - **compensating for the consumption of these cells in the
    inflammatory reaction**
- **Most bacterial infections → neutrophilia**
- **Viral infections → lymphocytosis**
- **Bronchial asthma, hay fever, and parasite infestations →
  eosinophilia**
- **typhoid fever, some viruses, rickettsiae, certain protozoa →
  leukopenia**

# Other manifestations of the acute-phase response

- **increased heart rate and blood pressure**
- **decreased sweating**
- **rigors (shivering)**
- **chills (perception of being cold as the hypothalamus resets the body
  temperature)**
- **anorexia**
- **somnolence**
- **malaise, probably secondary to the actions of cytokines on brain
  cells.**
- **TNF**
  - **disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**
  - **metabolic disturbances including acidosis**
  - **hypotensive shock**
