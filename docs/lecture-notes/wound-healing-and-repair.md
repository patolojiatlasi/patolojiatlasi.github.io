# Repair (Healing)

**Restoration of tissue architecture and function after an injury**

**Regeneration of the injured tissue**

**Scar formation by the deposition of connective tissue**

# Regeneration

- **replace the damaged cells**
- **return to a normal state**
- **occurs by**
  - **proliferation of residual (uninjured) cells that retain the
    capacity to divide**
  - **replacement from tissue stem cells **
- **skin and intestines**
  - **rapidly dividing epithelia**
- **liver**

# Scar formation (Nedbeleşme)

**Tissues incapable of regeneration**

**Supporting structures of the tissue are severely damaged**

**Repair occurs by the laying down of connective (fibrous) tissue → scar
formation**

**Cannot perform the function of lost parenchymal cells**

**Structural stability that the injured tissue is usually able to
function**

- **Extensive deposition of collagen**
- **Lungs, liver, kidney**
  - **Consequence of chronic inflammation**
- **Myocardium**
  - **Extensive ischemic necrosis (infarction)**

# Organization

**Organizing pneumonia**

**Fibrosis develops in a tissue space occupied by an inflammatory
exudate**

# Healing of Skin Wounds

# Healing by First Intention

**Clean, uninfected surgical incision**

**Approximated by surgical sutures**

**Focal disruption of epithelial basement membrane continuity**

**Death of relatively few epithelial and connective tissue cells**

**Epithelial regeneration is the principal mechanism of repair**

**A small scar is formed**

**There is minimal wound contraction**

**Incisional space first fills with fibrin-clotted blood**

**Rapidly invaded by granulation tissue**

**Covered by new epithelium**

**Within 24 hours**

**Neutrophils are seen at the incision margin, migrating to fibrin
clot**

**Basal cells at the cut edge of the epidermis increased mitotic
activity**

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair6.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Within 24 to 48 hours**

**Epithelial cells from both edges have begun to migrate and proliferate
along the dermis**

**Deposite basement membrane components as they progress**

**The cells meet in the midline beneath the surface scab**

**A thin but continuous epithelial layer.**

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair7.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**By day 3**

**Neutrophils replaced by macrophages**

**Granulation tissue progressively invades the incision space**

**Collagen fibers are evident at the incision margins, but these are
vertically oriented and do not bridge the incision**

**Epithelial cell proliferation continues, yielding a thickened
epidermal covering layer**

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair8.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**By day 5**

**Neovascularization reaches its peak**

**Granulation tissue fills the incisional space**

**Collagen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the
incision**

**The epidermis recovers its normal thickness**

**Differentiation of surface cells yields a mature epidermal
architecture with surface keratinization**

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair9.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**Second week**

**Continued collagen accumulation and fibroblast proliferation**

**The leukocyte infiltrate, edema, and increased vascularity are
substantially diminished**

**Increasing collagen deposition within the incisional scar**

**Regression of vascular channels**

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair10.png)

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

**By the end of the first month**

**Scar consists of a cellular connective tissue**

**No inflammatory cells**

**Covered by a normal epidermis**

**Dermal appendages destroyed in the line of the incision are
permanently lost The tensile strength of the wound increases with time**

# Healing by Second Intention

- **When cell or tissue loss is more extensive**
- **Large wounds**
- **Sites of abscess formation**
- **Ulceration**
- **Ischemic necrosis (infarction) in parenchymal organs**
- **The repair process is more complex **
  - **involves a combination of regeneration and scarring**

# Healing by Second Intention (secondary union)

![](./img-local/Wound-Healing-and-Repair13.png)

**Inflammatory reaction is more intense**

**Abundant granulation tissue**

**Robbins Basic Pathology**

# Healing by Second Intention

**Accumulation of ECM and formation of a large scar**

**Followed by wound contraction by myofibroblasts**

  tissues</span>

    mass**

    to mature cells**

    differentiating**
  - **can be induced to form specialized cells of all three germ cell
    layers**

  cells)</span>

  - **less undifferentiated**

# Fibrosis in Parenchymal Organs

**Excessive deposition of collagen and other ECM components in a
tissue**

**Deposition of collagen in chronic diseases.**

**The basic mechanisms of fibrosis are the same as those of scar
formation during tissue repair**

**Tissue repair occurs after a short-lived injurious stimulus, follows
an orderly sequence of steps**

**Fibrosis is induced by persistent injurious stimuli **

**Responsible for organ dysfunction and even organ failure**
