Figure 1 | Main metabolic adaptations associated with tumour burden. During tumour growth, substantial metabolic alterations take place in cancer patients. Thus, protein degradation is stimulated in skeletal muscle, which results in a massive amino acid efflux to the circulation. Therefore, a flow of nitrogen (mainly in the form of alanine) from skeletal muscle reaches the liver, where this amino acid is used to sustain gluconeogenesis and also the synthesis of acute-phase proteins. Glutamine is also exported from the muscle and used mainly in the tumour as a nitrogen donor for the synthesis of both protein and DNA. The tumour , depending on the availability of glucose, can also oxidize some glutamine. Adipose tissue mass is reduced owing to the activation of lipases, which participate in the lipolytic breakdown of triacylglycerols (TAGs), which produces both non-essential fatty acids (NEFAs) and glycerol. Glycerol can also be used to sustain liver gluconeogenesis while the NEFAs are used by the tumour mass, albeit at very low levels. Instead, tumour cells use huge amounts of glucose and thereby generate lactate, which is then exported to the circulation. The liver also uses lactate as a gluconeogenic substrate, partly to compensate for the acidosis associated with lactate production. The recycling of lactate constitutes a ‘Cori cycle’ (shown in purple) between the liver and the tumour , which is linked with high energetic inefficiency, as the conversion of glucose into lactate by the tumour generates much less ATP than the amount required to produce glucose from lactate. Circled “+” symbols indicate pathways that are activated during cachexia.

Figure 2 | Skeletal muscle wasting during cachexia. a | Alterations in metabolic pathways, apoptosis and regeneration. Muscle wasting involves alterations in protein and amino acid (AA) metabolism, together with activation of apoptosis and decreased regeneration. All of these alterations are linked with inflammation. b | Intracellular signals that participate in skeletal muscle wasting. Many intracellular signals are activated (shown in purple) by inflammatory mediators (such as cytokines and myostatin ) and tumour -derived factors (such as proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF)). Basically, cytokines and PIF increase protein degradation via nuclear factor- κB (NF‑ κB ) by activating forkhead (FOXO) family transcription factors; this allows for the increased transcription of genes encoding ubiquitin ligases (muscle atrophy F-box protein (MAFBX) and muscle RING finger-containing protein 1 (MURF1)) that are involved in the proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins. The same mediators (PIF and cytokines) can also activate the p38 and Janus kinase (JAK) MAPK cascades leading to increased caspase activity and, thus, apoptosis. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) normally promotes protein synthesis via AKT and mTOR; a decrease (shown in blue) in IGF1 during muscle wasting suppresses protein synthesis. Myostatin can also decrease protein synthesis (through AKT via SMAD2) and activate both protein degradation (via FOXOs) and apoptosis — through the MAPK cascade. Overexpression of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor- γ ?co-activator 1α ?(PGC1α) causes increased respiration and expression of genes linked to mitochondrial uncoupling and energy expenditure (such as uncoupling proteins (UCPs)).

Figure 4 | Cachexia as a multi-organ syndrome. In addition to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, other organs are affected by the cachectic process. In fact, the wasting that takes place in muscle could well be dependent on alterations in other organs or tissues, such as white adipose tissue (see the main text). Abnormalities in heart function, alterations in liver protein synthesis, changes in hypothalamic mediators and activation of brown adipose tissue are also involved in the cachectic syndrome.

Figure 5–35  Complementary DNA ( cDNA ) microarray analysis. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is extracted from the samples, reverse transcribed to cDNA , and labeled with fluorescent molecules. In the case illustrated, red fluorescent molecules were used for normal cDNA , and green molecules were used for tumor cDNA . The labeled cDNAs are mixed and applied to a gene chip, which contains thousands of DNA probes representing known genes. The labeled cDNAs hybridize to spots that contain complementary sequences. The hybridization is detected by laser scanning of the chip, and the results are read in units of red or green fluorescence intensity. In the example shown, spot A has high red fluorescence, indicating that a greater number of cDNAs from neoplastic cells hybridized to gene A. Thus, gene A seems to be upregulated in tumor cells.
